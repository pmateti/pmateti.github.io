<ol>
  <li> (12*5 points) In the following, it is <i>possible</i> to write
    between 5 to 10 sentences each, and yet receive full score.

    <ol type="a">
      <li> In the context of token-passing algorithms, what is a "token"?

      <li>Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading
	of asynchronous message passing. Is it because token-passing
	does not make sense under synchronous message passing? Discuss.

      <li> Construct the ssend(pid, msg) and srecv(pid, msg) primitives of
	synchronous message passing from asend(pid, msg) and arecv(pid,
	msg) primitives of asynchronous message passing.

      <li> Explain the Satisfaction Rule for Synchronous Communication.

      <li> The <i>happened before</i><b> </b>relation, as discussed,
	requires a logical clock for every process.  But a typical
	machine (node) in a distributed system runs several
	processes. Is it sufficient to maintain a logical clock per
	node that is shared by all processes running on that
	node?  Show by construction or discuss why this does not work.

      <li> In the context of distributed semaphore implementation,
	discuss "fully acknowledged" messages.

      <li> Can any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion
	problem be thought of as a solution to the problem of
	implementing semaphores in a distributed system, and vice
	versa? True/False? Discuss.

      <li> A binary "tree" is here given as a collection of its node
	contents: (1, 2, 3), (2, 0, 3), (3, 2, 4), (4, 2, 1).  Each
	node contents is a triplet of (info-integer, left-link,
	right-link).  The node with info integer 1 is the root.  Null
	links are 0.  Marshal/serialize the given binary tree.

      <li> Reconstruct the binary "tree" serialized below. List each
	node as a triplet of (info-integer, left-link, right-link),
	as usual.  The first digit in the sequence is the offset of
	the root node.	<pre>
	  marshaled sequence: 2 1 0 5 2 7 3 0 A 4 2 5 0
	  offsets in hex:     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D</pre>
	  
      <li> Does the precondition and statement {x &ge; 4 } &lt; x := x
	- 4 &gt; interfere with the triple<br> {x &ge; 10} &lt; x := x
	+ 5 &gt; {x &ge; 12}.
      <li> Using the technique of weakened assertions, prove that {x =
	0} S {x = 0} is a theorem, where S is var x := 0; co &lt;x :=
	x+2&gt; || &lt;x := x+3&gt; || &lt;x := x - 5&gt; oc

      <li> Explain, with an example, the map/reduce idea behind
      Hadoop.
    </ol>
  
  <li>(10+20+10 points) Given a large (in the zillions) bag B of
    integers, and a specific integer x, compute how many of B's
    integers are (i) greater than x, (ii) equal to x, and (iii) less
    than x.  Two solutions, one in CSP and another in C-Linda are to
    be developed.  It is not required that both use the same "idea."
    Present your solutions with full explanations.
    <ol type="a">
      <li> As usual, (i) we wish to maximize concurrency, (ii) we
	prefer a symmetric solution, (iii) we rate correctness much
	higher than efficiency, and cannot tolerate (iv) deadlocks or
	(v) livelocks.  Defend <i>why for each of these five. </i>
      <li> For C-Linda, assume that the tuple space already contains
	the <tt>bag of integers &lt; "B&quot;, n&gt;</tt>, the size of
	this bag <tt>&lt; "BSZ", bsz&gt;</tt>, and <tt>
	&lt; &quot;x&quot;, x&gt;</tt>.  You lose 5 points for each use
	of <tt>inp</tt> or <tt>rdp</tt>.  Choose a number of processes
	that maximizes concurrency.  At the end, we expect to see
	three tuples: < "greater", g >, < "equal", e >, and < "lesser", l >.

      <li> For CSP, the bag is generated by process B whose structure
	is <code>B :: *[ ... --&gt; P!m ]</code>.  Assume that the
	first two numbers output are bsz and x; the rest are integers
	of B.  Develop the process P and appropriately chosen other
	processes, if any.
