  <li>(10*5 points) Explain/ discuss/ dispute/ compute the following
    statements. It is <i>possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten,
    sentences each, and yet receive full score.

    <ol type="i">
	<li><i>wp(S, True ) = True</i> defines liveness of S.
	  True/False? Explain.
	<li> Compute <i>wp(S, i = 2)</i>, where S is 
	<tt>if i < 2 --> i := i + 1 [] i > 2 --> i := 2 fi</tt>


      <li> 	      Consider the program segment given here.

	<table width=100%>
	  <tr>
	    <td width=50% valign=top>
	      Determine <i>P</i> a predicate that characterizes the weakest
	      deadlock-free precondition for the program.
	      Also, explain how you arrived at P.

      </li>
<li>Since the semantics of <tt>S1 || S2</tt> permits their execution
  as if it is <tt>S1;S2</tt>, we can replace some occurrences, if not
  all, of <tt>S1;S2</tt> with <tt>S1 || S2</tt>.  True/False? Explain.</p>

<li>A scheduling policy that is strongly fair must also be weakly fair.
	Discuss.

      <li>&quot;Some day, if not at the end of CEG 730, you will
	appreciate and marvel at the book Concurrent Programming by
	Andrews.'' Explain if this is a safety,  or liveness
	property, or perhaps neither. </li>


      <li>In the context of RPC, a procedure designed to be called remotely
	<i>can</i> use global variables to communicate with the
	caller, provided we modify <i>rpcgen</i> appropriately.
	True/False? Explain.

      <li>Marshalling in RPC is no more than a tight-packing of the
	bytes of the input arguments. True/False? Explain.

      <li>The code <code>V(s); P(s)</code> is <i>always</i> equivalent
      to a no-op (&quot;skip&quot;, or do-nothing).  True/False? Explain.

      <li>The "standard solution" <tt> P(m); CS; V(m)</tt> is
      starvation-free in the context of non-distributed systems.

    </ol>
  </li>
  

  <li>(25 points) Consider the following as an <b>await</b>-statement
   based model of the classic Dining Philosophers Problem. The
   expression <tt>i + 1</tt> throughout is modulo 5. The <tt>up</tt>
   and <tt>dn</tt> (down) refer to whether the philosopher picked the
   fork up or put the fork down.
    <blockquote>
      <pre>   global int up[0..4], dn[0..4] initially all 0;
   philosopher[i: 0..4]::
     do true -->
   	think
   	< await up[i] == dn[i] --> up[i] ++ >
   	< await up[i+1] == dn[i+1] --> up[i+1] ++ >
        eat
   	< dn[i] ++ >
   	< dn[i+1] ++ >
     od
</pre>
</blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li>(15 points) Using the Pass-the-Baton technique systematically
  convert it to an equivalent algorithm using semaphores only. For
  now, disregard if the above is a ``solution'' or not.</li>
<li>(10 points) Is this a deadlock-, livelock-, starvation-free
  ``solution'' to the Dining Philosophers Problem? If so, explain. If
  not so, fix it at the <b>await</b>-statement level .
</ol>
</li>

<li>(25 points) The <i><it>Recursive Data Representation: Small Set of
      Integers</it></i> of Hoare's CSP paper is reproduced below. (a)
      (20 points) Extend it to respond to a
      request <tt>S(1)!secondMin()</tt> from S(0) that expects a reply
      with the second minimum of elements in the set if the set has
      more than 1 elements, or "undefined" otherwise.  Include an
      explanation of how it works. (b) (5 points) Include a convincing
      argument/proof that your extension is correct, and that you have
      not broken existing functionality.
  <blockquote>  
<pre>
S(i: 1 .. 100) ::
    do  n: integer; S(i-1)?has(n) --> S(0)!false
