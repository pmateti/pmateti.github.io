  <li> (6*5 points) The following statements may or may not be (fully
or partially) valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain/ discuss/
dispute the statement.&nbsp; It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
than, say, five thoughtful sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    <ol type="a">
      <li> <i>`Some day, if not at the end of CEG 730, 
    you will appreciate and marvel at the book Concurrent Programming by 
    Andrews.''</i>&nbsp; is neither a <i>safety</i>, nor a <i>liveness</i> 
    property.</li>
      <li>Every<i> distributed system</i> must also be a <i>concurrent system</i>.</li>
      <li> <i>Asynchronous</i>&nbsp; message passing is more fundamental than <i>
      synchronous</i> message passing.</li>
      <li> <i>Token-passing </i>algorithms were discussed under the heading of&nbsp; asynchronous message passing because token-passing does not make
sense under synchronous message passing.</li>
      <li> The <i>happened
before</i><b> </b>relation, as in the book, requires a logical clock for every 
      process.&nbsp; But&nbsp; a typical machine (node) in a distributed system 
      runs several processes. It is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per 
      node that is shared by all processes running on that node.</li>
		<li> Peer-to-peer distributed computing is just an academic 
		term for the commercial term client-server computing.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>(5+5+5+5 points) It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
than, say, five thoughtful sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    <ol type="a">
      <li> Describe the problem of &quot;termination detection.&quot;</li>
      <li> Discuss why detection of termination is difficult.</li>
      <li> Describe a termination detection algorithm of your choice.</li>
		<li> Describe the distributed implementation of semaphore of 
		our text book.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(10+20+20 points) You are given a large (in the zillions) bag B of 
	pairs of unsigned integers (x,&nbsp; d).&nbsp; Each pair represents a horizontal line 
  segment of length d in the Euclidean plane whose left end point is at (x, 
	0).&nbsp;&nbsp; A (x1,  
  d1) <i>contains</i> (x2, d2) if&nbsp; x1 &lt;= x2 and x1 + d1 &gt;= x2 + 
  d2.&nbsp; We wish to compute Bmin which minimize the size (== number of 
	pairs) of&nbsp; B so that every original pair in B is contained in some 
  pair in the resulting collection Bmin.&nbsp;
	<ol type="a">  <li>
  (5 + 5 points)
  As usual, we wish to maximize concurrency, we prefer a 
  symmetric solution, we rate correctness much higher than efficiency, and 
  cannot tolerate deadlocks or livelocks. Defend <i>why</i> we prefer a symmetric solution 
  (5 points) , and&nbsp; 
  <i>why</i>
we rate correctness much higher than efficiency (5 points) .</li>
      <li>
  (10 + 10 points)
  Fully explain (10 points) your solution design&nbsp; in English for Linda and 
	on a fresh page implement&nbsp; (10 points) it in C-Linda.
Assume that the tuple space already contains <tt>&lt;"t&quot;, x, d&gt;</tt> 
  of B, and the size of this
bag <tt>&lt;"sz", N&gt;</tt>. You lose 2 points for each use of <tt>inp</tt>
or <tt>rdp</tt>. </li>
      <li>
  (10 + 10 points)&nbsp; Fully explain &nbsp;(10 points) your solution design in English for CSP.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  It is not required that this use the same &quot;design idea(s)&quot; of the above. Implement&nbsp; (10 points) 
  on a fresh page the design in CSP.&nbsp; The bag B is now generated by 
  process Q whose structure is <code>Q :: *[ ... --&gt; P!(x, d) ]</code>.&nbsp; Develop the process 
  P and 
  any others.</li></ol></li>
