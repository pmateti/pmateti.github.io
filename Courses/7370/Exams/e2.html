  <li> (12*5 points) In the following, it is <i>possible</i> to write
    between 5 to 10 sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    Explain/ discuss/ dispute/ compute/ prove.

    <ol type="a">
      <li> There are examples of safety properties that are also
	liveness properties.
      <li>Detection of termination is difficult only in peer-to-peer
	distributed computing not in client-server computing.
      <li> Construct the ssend(B, msg) and srecv(B, msg) primitives of
	synchronous message passing from asend(B, msg) and arecv(B,
	msg) primitives of asynchronous message passing.
      <li> Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading
	of asynchronous message passing because token-passing does not
	make sense under synchronous message passing.
      <li> The <i>happened before</i><b> </b>relation, as discussed,
	requires a logical clock for every process.  But a typical
	machine (node) in a distributed system runs several
	processes. It is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per
	node that is shared by all processes running on that
	node.
		<li> Reconstruct the binary &quot;tree&quot; serialized below. List each node 
		as a triplet of (info integer, left-link and right-link), as usual.  
		The first digit in the sequence is the offset of the root node.<br>
		<code>marshaled sequence: 2 1 4 2 6 3 4 9 4 0 2 9 9<br>
		offsets in hex:     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D</code>
		<li> Does the precondition and statement {x  &ge; 4 } &lt; x := x - 4 
		&gt; interfere with the triple<br>
		{x is odd} &lt; x := x + 5 &gt; {x is even}.
		<li> Using the technique of weakened assertions, prove that {x = 0} S {x 
		= 9} is a theorem, where S is var x := 0; co &lt;x := x+2&gt; || &lt;x := x+3&gt; || 
		&lt;x := x+4&gt; oc
		<li> Explain the Receive Axiom: {P} receive ch(vars) {Q}.
		<li> Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the
truly distributed context.
		<li> Can any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem be 
		thought of as a solution to the problem of implementing semaphores in a 
		distributed system, and vice versa.
		<li> Explain, with an example, the map/reduce idea behind Hadoop.
    </ol>
  
  <li>(10+15+15 points) Given a large (in the zillions) bag B of integers, find the 
	third largest number in B.  Assume that B has at least three distinct 
	integers. Two solutions,
one in CSP and another in C-Linda are to be developed.  It is not
required that both use the same "idea."  Present your solutions with full explanations. 
	<b>(a)</b> (10 points) As usual, (i) we wish to maximize 
  concurrency, (ii) we prefer a symmetric solution, (iii) we rate correctness much higher 
  than efficiency, and cannot tolerate (iv) deadlocks or (v) livelocks.  
	Defend <i>why for each of these five.  </i><b>(b)</b>  For C-Linda, assume that the tuple 
	space already contains the <tt>bag of integers &lt;"B&quot;, n&gt;</tt>, the size of this
bag <tt>&lt;"BSZ", bsz&gt;, and &lt;&quot;p&quot;, p&gt; the</tt> number of worker processes.. You lose 5 points for each use of <tt>inp</tt>
or <tt>rdp</tt>. <b> (c) 
	</b> For CSP, the bag is generated by 
  process B whose structure is <code>B :: *[ ... --&gt; P!n ]</code>.  Develop the process 
	P and an appropriately chosen other processes.
