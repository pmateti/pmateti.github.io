<ol>
  <li>(6*5 points) Explain/ discuss/ dispute/ compute the following
    statements. It is <i>possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten,
    sentences each, and yet receive full score.

    <ol type="a">
      <li>Consider the following program segment:
	<pre>
	  co &lt;await x &gt;= 3 -&gt; x := x - 3&gt;
	  || &lt;await x &gt;= 2 -&gt; x := x - 2&gt;
	  || &lt;await x == 1 -&gt; x := x + 5&gt;
	  oc</pre>

	Let <i>P</i> be a predicate that characterizes the weakest
	deadlock-free precondition for the program, i.e., the largest
	set of states such that, if the program is begun in a state
	satisfying <i>P</i>, then it will terminate if scheduling is
	weakly-fair. Determine <i>P</i>.  Explain how you arrived at P. </li>

      <li> Compute <i>wp(S, i = 2)</i>, where S is <tt>if i < 2 -> i
	    := i+1 [] i > 2 -> i := 2 fi</tt></li>

      <li>The semantics of&nbsp; <TT>S1 || S2</TT> permits their
	execution as if it is <TT>S1;S2</TT> True/False? Explain.</li>
      <li>The code <code>V(s); P(s)</code> is <i>always</i> equivalent
      to a no-op (&quot;skip&quot;, or do-nothing).  True/False? Explain.</li>

      <li>In the context of RPC, a procedure designed to be called remotely
	<i>can</i> use global variables to communicate with the
	caller.  True/False? Explain.</li>
      <li>Marshalling in RPC is no more than a tight-packing of the
	bytes of the input arguments. True/False? Explain.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  

<li>(30 points) The <i><it>Recursive Data Representation: Small Set of
      Integers</it></i> of Hoare's CSP paper is reproduced below. (a)
      (20 points) Extend it to respond to a
      command <tt>S(1)!remove(x)</tt> from S(0) that removes x from
      the set, if it contains it, and does nothing if it does not. (b)
      (10 points) Include a convincing argument that your extension is
      correct.
  <blockquote>  <pre>
    S(i: 1 .. 100) ::
    *[   n: integer; S(i-1)?has(n) --> S(0)!false
     []  n: integer; S(i-1)?insert(n) -->
            *[  m: integer; S(i-1)?has(m) -->
                 [   m <=  n --> S(0)!(m = n)
                 []  m >   n --> S(i+1)!has(m)
                 ]
             [] m: integer; S(i-1)?insert(m) -->
                 [  m < n --> S(i+1)!insert(n); n := m
                 [] m = n -->  skip
                 [] m > n --> S(i+1)!insert(m)
     ] ] ]</pre>  </blockquote>
</li>

<li>(40 points) Consider the following as an <b>await</b>-statement
  based model of the classic Dining Philosophers problem.   The
  expression <tt>i + 1</tt> throughout is modulo 5. The <tt>up</tt>
  and <tt>dn</tt> (down) refer to whether the philosopher picked the
  fork up or put the fork down.
  <ol type="a">
    <li>(20 points) Using the Pass-the-Baton technique systematically convert it
      to an equivalent algorithm using semaphores only. For now, disregard if 
      the above is a ``solution'' or not.
    <li>(10 points) Is this ``solution'' free from starvation? Explain your 
      answers fully. A simple yes/no will not do.<li>(10 points) Is this a ``solution'' to the Dining Philosophers problem? If 
      so, explain. If not so, fix it at the <b>await</b>-statement level .
     </ol>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>   var up[0..4], dn[0..4] initially all 0;
   philosopher[i: 0..4]::
     do true -&gt;
   	think
   	&lt;await up[i] == dn[i] --&gt; up[i] ++&gt;
   	&lt;await up[i+1] == dn[i+1] --&gt; up[i+1] ++&gt;
