      <li> (15*5 points) In the following, it is <i>possible</i> to write
	no more than, say, ten, sentences each, and yet receive full
	score.&nbsp; Explain/ discuss/ dispute/ compute/ construct/
	prove.
	<ol type="i">
	  <li> "A distributed system is one in which the failure of a
	    computer you didn't even know existed can render your own
	    computer unusable."  Is this a good definition?
	  <li> In a collection of semaphores that constitutes a split
	  binary semaphore, at least one of them must be 1.</li>
	  <li> A safety property is any property that is asserted to be true
	    throughout the life of a process.</li>
	  <li>Detection of termination is difficult only in peer-to-peer
	    distributed computing not in client-server computing.</li>
	  <li> Construct the <tt>ssend(B, msg)</tt> and <tt>srecv(B,
	      msg)</tt> primitives of SMP that a process A uses in
	    communicating with another process B from <tt>asend(B,
	      msg)</tt> and <tt>arecv(B, msg)</tt> primitives of
	    AMP.&nbsp; </li>
	  <li> Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading
	    of AMP because token-passing does not make sense under
	    SMP.</li>
	  <li> The <i>happened before</i> relation, as discussed, requires
	    a logical clock for every process.&nbsp; But&nbsp; a typical
	    machine (node) in a distributed system runs several
	    processes. It is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per
	    node that is shared by all processes running on that
	    node.</li>
	  <li> Given a solution to the distributed mutual exclusion
	    problem, we can construct semaphores in a distributed
	    system, and vice versa.</li>
	  <li>Reconstruct the binary &quot;tree&quot; serialized
	    below. List each node as a triplet of (info integer,
	    left-link and right-link), as usual.&nbsp; The first digit
	    in the sequence is the offset of the root node.<br>
	    <tt>marshalled sequence: 2 3 4 7 4 7 8 4 A 1 4 2 7<br>
	      offsets in hex:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D</tt></li>
	  <li> Verify if the precondition and statement {x&nbsp; &ge; 9 }
	    &lt; x := x - 9 &gt; interferes with the triple<br> {x is
	    odd} &lt; x := x + 2 &gt; {x is even}.</li>
	  <li> Let S contain <sr>&lt; await B &rarr; T &gt;</sr>.  Let S' be S
	  with the await statement replaced by <sr>do not B &rarr;
	  skip od; T</sr>.  Then, {P} S {Q} holds if and only if {P} S'
	  {Q} holds.
	  </li>

	  <li> In SR, what is the effect of sending a message to an op
	    implemented as a procedure?</li>
	  <li> Explain, with an example, the map/reduce idea behind
	    Hadoop.</li>
	  <li>Consider the code block below.  Do any of the temporal
	    assertions shown hold?  When?  How?
	    <table><tr>
		<td width=45% valign=top>
		  <a name=prog></a>
		  <sr>
		    int x := 0; int y := 0;<br>
		    do  < await true &rarr;  x := x + 1><br>
                    []  < await true &rarr;  y := y + 1><br>
                    od</sr>
		</td>
		<td width=5%>&nbsp;</td>
		<td width=50% valign=top>
		  always x = 0<br>
		  eventually x > 5<br>
		  eventually always y = 3
		</td></tr></table>
				       </li>
        <li> We wish to maximize (a) concurrency, we prefer (b)
  	  symmetric solutions, we rate&nbsp; (c) correctness much
  	  higher than efficiency, and cannot tolerate (d) deadlocks
  	  or (e) livelocks.&nbsp; Defend <i>why</i> for each of
  	  these five.</li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>(15+5+5 points) Given a large (in the zillions) set S of
	integers, construct a bag B from it by multiplying every pair
	of integers of S.&nbsp; Present&nbsp; the solution in
	C/Java+Linda (20 points), with&nbsp; full explanation (5
	points) written separately from the code.&nbsp;Assume that the
	tuple space already contains the set of integers <tt>("S",
	x)</tt>, and the size of this set <tt>("SZ", sz)</tt>.  Choose
	and explain your choice of <tt>("p", p)</tt> the number of worker
	processes that maximizes concurrency (5 points).  The tuple
	space at the end should only contain <tt>("B", b)</tt>.  You lose 5
	points for <i>each</i> use of <tt>inp</tt>
	or <tt>rdp</tt>. </li>
