\begin{enumerate}

\item (5*5 points)
Explain, in a few lines, the truth or falsity of the following
statements.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Every distributed system must also be a concurrent system.

\item
There is no difference between safety and liveness properties.

\item
The difference between asynchronous and synchronous message
passing is trivial.

\item
Interference-free implies that processes do not have shared variables.

\item Marshalling in \RPC\ is no more than a tight-packing
of the bytes of the input arguments or resulting values.

\end{enumerate}

\item (30 points)
We have a \CSP\ process {\tt C} that outputs an unending stream of
non-negative numbers to a process named, say, {\tt X}.  We want {\tt
X} to be able to receive requests of the form {\tt X!nthmin(n)} from a
user process {\tt U} and respond with {\tt U!x}, where $x$ is the
$n$-th smallest number it has seen so far from {\tt C}.  If {\tt X}
has seen fewer than $n$ numbers so far, or if $n$ is greater than 10,
or less than 1, the value of $x$ to use is -1.  Write the process {\tt
X} in \CSP.  Maximize concurrency.  Process {\tt C} must not suffer
delays.

\item (5+15 points) Solve the producer/consumer problem (a) using
await statements, and then (b) using semaphores systematically
applying the pass-the-baton technique.

\item (10+15 points)  Udding's solution to the mutual exclusion problem
is reproduced below.  (a) Explain the purpose of each of the
semaphores, using invariants. (b) In the Concluding remarks section,
the author comments ``In this program as in previous programs that
implement semaphores, the order of two V-operations, viz., {\tt V(eu)}
and {\tt V(qu)}, turns out to be crucial.''  There are three
occurrences of {\tt V(eu)}.  Which one is he referring to?  Explain
what would happen if we exchange {\tt V(eu)} with {\tt V(qu)}.

\begin{verbatim}
 1 P(eu); ne := ne+1; V(eu);
 2 P(qu); P(eu);	    
 3	nm := nm+1;	    
 4	ne := ne-1;	    
 5	if ne > 0 --> V(eu) 
 6	[] ne = 0 --> V(mu) 
 7	fi;		    
 8 V(qu);		    
 9 P(mu); nm := nm-1;	    
10	<cs >		    
11	if nm > 0 -->  V(mu)
12	[] nm = 0 -->  V(eu)
13	fi		    
\end{verbatim}

\end{enumerate}
