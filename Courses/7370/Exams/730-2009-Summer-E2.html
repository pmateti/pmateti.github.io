  <li> (12*5 points) In the&nbsp; following, it is <i>possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten,
    sentences each, and yet receive full score.&nbsp; Explain/ discuss/ dispute/ 
	compute/ prove.<ol type="a">
      <li> There are examples of safety properties that are also liveness
properties.</li>
      <li>Detection of termination is difficult only in peer-to-peer distributed 
      computing not in client-server computing.</li>
      <li> Construct the ssend(B, msg) and srecv(B, msg) primitives of 
		synchronous message passing from asend(B, msg) and arecv(B, msg) 
		primitives of asynchronous message passing.</li>
      <li> Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading of
asynchronous message passing because token-passing does not make
sense under synchronous message passing.</li>
      <li> The <i>happened
before</i><b> </b>relation, as discussed, requires a logical clock for every 
      process.&nbsp; But&nbsp; a typical machine (node) in a distributed system 
      runs several processes. It is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per 
      node that is shared by all processes running on that node.</li>
		<li> Reconstruct the binary &quot;tree&quot; serialized below. List each node 
		as a triplet of (info integer, left-link and right-link), as usual.&nbsp; 
		The first digit in the sequence is the offset of the root node.<br>
		<code>marshaled sequence: 2 1 4 2 6 3 4 9 4 0 2 9 9<br>
		offsets in hex:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D</code></li>
		<li> Does the precondition and statement {x&nbsp; &ge; 4 } &lt; x := x - 4 
		&gt; interfere with the triple<br>
		{x is odd} &lt; x := x + 5 &gt; {x is even}.</li>
		<li> Using the technique of weakened assertions, prove that {x = 0} S {x 
		= 9} is a theorem, where S is var x := 0; co &lt;x := x+2&gt; || &lt;x := x+3&gt; || 
		&lt;x := x+4&gt; oc</li>
		<li> Explain the Receive Axiom: {P} receive ch(vars) {Q}.</li>
		<li> Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the
truly distributed context.</li>
		<li> Can any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem be 
		thought of as a solution to the problem of implementing semaphores in a 
		distributed system, and vice versa.</li>
		<li> Explain, with an example, the map/reduce idea behind Hadoop.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(10+15+15 points) Given a large (in the zillions) bag B of integers, find the 
	third largest number in B.&nbsp; Assume that B has at least three distinct 
	integers. Two solutions,
one in CSP and another in C-Linda are to be developed.&nbsp; It is not
required that both use the same "idea."&nbsp; Present your solutions with full explanations.&nbsp;
	<b>(a)</b> (10 points) As usual, (i) we wish to maximize 
  concurrency, (ii) we prefer a symmetric solution, (iii) we rate correctness much higher 
  than efficiency, and cannot tolerate (iv) deadlocks or (v) livelocks.&nbsp; 
	Defend <i>why for each of these five.&nbsp; </i><b>(b)</b>&nbsp; For C-Linda, assume that the tuple 
	space already contains the <tt>bag of integers &lt;"B&quot;, n&gt;</tt>, the size of this
bag <tt>&lt;"BSZ", bsz&gt;, and &lt;&quot;p&quot;, p&gt; the</tt> number of worker processes.. You lose 5 points for each use of <tt>inp</tt>
or <tt>rdp</tt>.&nbsp;<b> (c) 
	</b>&nbsp;For CSP, the bag is generated by 
  process B whose structure is <code>B :: *[ ... --&gt; P!n ]</code>.&nbsp; Develop the process 
	P and an appropriately chosen other processes.</li>
