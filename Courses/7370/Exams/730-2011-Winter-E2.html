  <li> (15*5 points) In the following, it is <i>possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten,
    sentences each, and yet receive full score.&nbsp; Explain/ discuss/ dispute/ 
	compute/ construct/ prove.<ol type="i">
      <li> Define a split binary semaphore.</li>
		<li> There are examples of safety properties that are also liveness
properties.</li>
      <li>Detection of termination is difficult only in peer-to-peer distributed 
      computing not in client-server computing.</li>
      <li> Construct the <tt>ssend(B, msg)</tt> and <tt>srecv(B, msg)</tt> primitives of 
		SMP that a process A uses in communicating with 
		another process B from <tt>asend(B, msg)</tt> and <tt>arecv(B, msg)</tt> 
		primitives of AMP.&nbsp; </li>
      <li> Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading of
		AMP because token-passing does not make
sense under SMP.</li>
      <li> The <i>happened before</i> relation, as discussed, requires a logical clock for every 
      process.&nbsp; But&nbsp; a typical machine (node) in a distributed system 
      runs several processes. It is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per 
      node that is shared by all processes running on that node.</li>
		<li> Reconstruct the binary &quot;tree&quot; serialized below. List each node 
		as a triplet of (info integer, left-link and right-link), as usual.&nbsp; 
		The first digit in the sequence is the offset of the root node.<br>
		<tt>marshaled sequence: 2 1 4 2 6 3 4 9 4 0 2 9 9<br>
		offsets in hex:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D</tt></li>
		<li> Can a random sequence of 13 digits be substituted for the marshaled 
		sequence above and yet be able to construct a &quot;tree&quot;?</li>
		<li> Does the precondition and statement {x&nbsp; &ge; 4 } &lt; x := x - 4 
		&gt; interfere with the triple<br>
		{x is odd} &lt; x := x + 5 &gt; {x is even}.</li>
		<li> Using the technique of weakened assertions, prove that {x = 1} S {x 
		= 7} is a theorem, where S is <tt>&nbsp;co &lt; x := x+1&gt; || &lt; x := x+2&gt; || &lt; x := x+3&gt; oc</tt></li>
		<li> Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the
truly distributed context.</li>
		<li> Given a solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem, we 
		can construct semaphores in a 
		distributed system, and vice versa.</li>
		<li> In SR, what is the effect of sending a message to an op 
		implemented as a procedure?</li>
		<li> Explain, with an example, the map/reduce idea behind Hadoop.</li>
		<li> We wish to maximize 
  		(a) concurrency, we prefer a (b) symmetric solution, we rate&nbsp; (c) correctness much higher 
  than efficiency, and cannot tolerate (d) deadlocks or (e) livelocks.&nbsp; 
	Defend <i>why</i> for each of these five.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(20+5 points) Given a large (in the zillions) set S of integers, construct 
	a bag B from it by duplicating every integer <i>d</i> times.&nbsp; Present&nbsp; 
	the solution in C/Java+Linda (20 points), with&nbsp; full explanation (5 
	points) written separately from the code.&nbsp;Assume that the tuple 
	space already contains the set  of integers <tt>&lt;"S&quot;, x&gt;</tt>, the 
	size of this set <tt>&lt;"SZ", sz&gt;</tt>, and <tt>&lt;&quot;d&quot;, d&gt;</tt> the number of 
	duplications, <tt>&lt;&quot;p&quot;, p&gt;</tt> the number of worker processes. 
	The tuple space at the end should contain <tt>&lt;&quot;B&quot;, b&gt;</tt>.  You lose 5 points for each use of
	<tt>inp</tt>
or <tt>rdp</tt>. &nbsp;<b> </b></li>
