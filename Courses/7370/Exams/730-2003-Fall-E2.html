  <li>(5*5 points) The following statements may or may not be (fully or 
  partially) valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain the technical terms occurring in the 
  statement.&nbsp; Explain/ discuss/ dispute the statement.&nbsp; It is <i>
  possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten, sentences each, and yet receive 
  full score.
  <ol type="a">
    <li>The property&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>``Some day, if not at the end of CEG 730, 
    you will appreciate and marvel at the book Concurrent Programming by 
    Andrews.''</i>&nbsp; is neither a <i>safety</i>, nor a <i>liveness</i> 
    property.</li>
    <li>A scheduling policy that is <i>strongly fair</i> must also be <i>weakly 
    fair</i>.</li>
    <li>Java RMI is RPC applied in the context of OOP and the Java language.</li>
    <li>Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading of 
    ``asynchronous message passing'' because token-passing does not make sense 
    under synchronous message passing.</li>
    <li>A typical machine (node) in a distributed system can run several 
    concurrent processes. Each of these processes must maintain its own logical 
    clock in order to correctly deal with the <i>happened before</i><b> </b>
    relation.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(5*5 points)
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the truly 
    distributed context. </li>
    <li>Describe the distributed implementation of semaphore of our text book.
    </li>
    <li>There are numerous ACK messages being sent.&nbsp; Discuss if any or all 
    of these are unnecessary. </li>
    <li>Does it implement a weak, strong (or neither) semaphore? </li>
    <li>Can any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem be thought 
    of as a solution to the problem of implementing semaphores in a distributed 
    system, and vice versa.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(5*10 points) In a bag <i>B</i> of&nbsp; <i>b</i> integers, it is known 
  that each element appears exactly <i>d</i> times. We wish to delete the 
  duplicates resulting in a set of only <i>b/d</i> distinct integers that 
  occurred in the bag. It is guaranteed that <i>d &gt; 0, b &gt; 0</i>. Unfortunately, 
  the value <i>d</i> is unavailable and needs to be computed by examining the 
  bag B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two solutions, one in CSP and another in C-Linda are to be 
  developed.&nbsp; It is not required that both use the same &quot;idea.&quot;&nbsp; You 
  are expected to present your design and implementation <i>with full 
  explanations</i>.&nbsp; As usual, we wish to maximize concurrency, we prefer a 
  symmetric solution, and we rate correctness much higher than efficiency.&nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li>(a) Design, and (b) implement a solution in C-Linda. Assume that the 
    tuple space already contains <tt>&lt;&quot;B&quot;, x<sub>i</sub>&gt; </tt>for all <tt>x<sub>i</sub></tt> 
    in B, and the size of the bag <tt>&lt;&quot;b&quot;, b&gt;</tt>. You lose 5 points for each 
    use of <tt>inp</tt> or <tt>rdp</tt>. </li>
    <li>(c) Design, and (d) implement a solution in CSP. Assume that the bag is 
    already distributed, one element per process.&nbsp; Thus, there are <i>b</i> 
    processes, each with exactly one element.&nbsp; After the algorithm 
    terminates, some of these processes will be &quot;empty handed.&quot; </li>
    <li>(e) Defend <i>why</i> we wish to maximize concurrency,&nbsp; <i>why</i> 
    we prefer a symmetric solution, and&nbsp; <i>why</i> we rate correctness 
    much higher than efficiency.</li>
