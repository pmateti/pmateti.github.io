      <p>This take-home exam permits the use of a Linux/Windows
	      laptop/desktop running javac, g++, Eclipse, Idea, and other
	      software development and drawing tools.  It is otherwise a
	      traditional closed book, closed notes exam.  In particular,
	      you are honor bound <i>*not*</i> to Internet surf or access
	      any content already existing (other than as indicated) once
	      you access the exam until you turnin the answers.  The primary
	      reasons in making this a take-home are to relieve time
	      pressure and give you a comfortable (computing/home)
	      environment.  Do not give or take help from others.  Submit
	      your <code>answers.pdf</code> in the Google Classroom. *Not*
	      as an email attachment.

  <ol type=I>
      <li>TBD 4 (5 points each) The following statements may or may not be
	(fully or partially) valid.  Explain the underlined technical
	terms</i> occurring in each statement.  Explain/ discuss/
	dispute the statement.  It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
	than, say, five, lines each, and yet receive full score.

  <ol>

    <li>A &quot;safety'' property is defined thus: Let&nbsp;
    <b>bad</b> be a predicate characterizing a "bad" state of program
    code segment S.  Assume that <u>{P} S {Q}</u> holds. Assume that I is a
    global <u>invariant</u>. If I implies the&nbsp; negation of <b>bad</b>,
    we say that <b>not bad </b>is a safety property for S. Thus, it
    all depends on whether&nbsp; <i>we consider a certain property
    good or bad.</i></li>

    <li>In a collection of <u>semaphores</u> that constitutes a
    <u>split binary semaphore</u>, at least one of them must be 1.

    <li>The <u>happened before</u> relation (as in the book, e.g.)
    requires a <u>logical clock</u> for every process.  But a typical
    machine (node) in a distributed system runs several processes.
    So, it is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per node that is
    shared by all processes running on that node.

    <li> "A distributed system is one in which the failure of a
    computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer
    unusable." Is this a good definition?

  </ol>


<li> (20 points each)
  <ol>
    
    <li> In distributed computing, we wish to maximize
    (i) <u>concurrency</u>, we prefer (ii) <u>symmetric solutions</u>,
    we rate (iii) <u>correctness</u> much higher than efficiency, and
    cannot tolerate (iv) <u>deadlocks</u> or (v) <u>livelocks</u>.
    (a) (10 points) Define and explain the five underlined technical
    terms.  (b) (10 points) Defend <i>why</i> for each of these five
    expectations.


  <li>
   Consider the following <b>await</b>-statement based model of the
   classic Dining Philosophers problem.  The expression <tt>i + 1</tt>
   throughout is modulo 5. The <tt>up</tt> and <tt>dn</tt> (down)
   refer to whether the philosopher picked the fork up or put the fork
   down.  There are no fat- or parallel bars in this code. TBD ang brackets

   <blockquote><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp; var up[0..4], dn[0..4] initially all 0;
&nbsp;&nbsp; philosopher[i: 0..4]::
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do true &#8594;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 	think;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 	&lt;await up[i] == dn[i] &#8594; up[i]++ &gt; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 	&lt;await up[i+1] == dn[i+1] &#8594; up[i+1]++ &gt; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 	eat;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 	&lt;dn[i]++ &gt; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp; 	&lt;dn[i+1]++ &gt; ;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; od</pre></blockquote>

   For now, disregard if the above is a ``solution'' or not.  Explain
   your answers fully.  (a)(10 points) Using the Pass-the-Baton
   technique systematically convert it to an equivalent algorithm
   using semaphores only and no awaits.  (b)(10 points) Is this
   code free from starvation?
  <li> Do any of the temporal assertions below for the code block at
    left hold?  Where? When?  How? Under weakly fair scheduling?
    Under strongly fair? Note the fat-bar.  Mathematical reasoning is
    expected.  Intuitive reasoning will deprive you of full score.
