  <li>(6*5 points) Explain, in a few lines, the truth or falsity of the
    following statements.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem can be
        thought of as a solution to the problem of implementing semaphores in a
        distributed system, and vice versa.</li>
      <li>A &quot;safety'' property is defined thus: Let&nbsp; <b>bad</b> be a
        predicate characterizing a ``bad'' state of program code segment S.
        Assume that {P}S {Q} holds. Assume that I is a global invariant. If I
        implies the&nbsp; negation of <b>bad</b>, we say that <b>not bad </b>is
        a safety property for S. Thus, it all depends on whether&nbsp; <i>we
        consider a certain property good or bad.</i></li>
      <li>&quot;Some day, if not at the end of CEG 730, you will appreciate and
        marvel at the book Concurrent Programming by Andrews.'' Explain if this
        is a safety, or liveness property, or perhaps neither.</li>
      <li>Asynchronous message passing cannot be implemented using synchronous
        message passing primitives.</li>
      <li>The CSP code <tt>[X!2 || Y!3]</tt> is equivalent to&nbsp;<tt><br>
        [true -&gt; X!2; Y!3 [] true -&gt; Y!3; X!2]</tt></li>
      <li>Java RMI is RPC applied in the context of the Java language.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
  <li>(25 points) Given a bag B of integers, and the size b of it. It is known
    that each element in the bag appears exactly d times. We wish to delete the
    duplicates resulting in a set of only b/d distinct elements that occurred in
    the bag. It is guaranteed that d &gt; 0, b &gt; 0. Unfortunately, the value
    d is unavailable and needs to be computed by examining the bag B. Design (15
    points, with full explanation) and implement (10 points) a solution in
    C-Linda. Assume that the tuple space already contains <tt>&lt;&quot;B&quot;,
    i&gt; </tt>for all <tt>i</tt> in B, and the size of the bag <tt>&lt;&quot;nB&quot;,
    b&gt; </tt>. You lose 2 points for each use of <tt>inp</tt> or <tt>rdp</tt>.
    As usual, we wish to maximize concurrency, we prefer a symmetric solution,
    and correctness rates much much higher than efficiency.<br>
  </li>
  <li>(25 points) Consider the above problem in the context of CSP, but with the
    following differences.&nbsp; There are b processes each holding exactly one
    number of the bag B.&nbsp; Each of these processes also has the number d.&nbsp;
    Do not assume that the elements they hold are in any particular numerical
    order. Design (15 points, with full explanation) and&nbsp; implement (10
    points) a CSP solution so that at the end of the algorithm the first b/d
    processes each hold one number, in no particular order, and all the
    remaining processes are empty handed.&nbsp; Explain your solution fully.&nbsp;
    As usual, we wish to maximize concurrency, we prefer a symmetric solution,
    and correctness rates much much higher than efficiency.<br>
  </li>
  <li>(5+5+5+5 points) (a) Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore
    in the truly distributed context. (b) Describe the happened-before relation.
    (c) Describe the distributed implementation of semaphore of our text book.
    (d) Does it implement a weak, strong or neither semaphore?</li>
