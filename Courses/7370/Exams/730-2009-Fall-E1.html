  <li>(10*5 points) Explain/ discuss/ dispute/ compute the following
    statements. It is <i>possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten,
    sentences each, and yet receive full score.

    <ol type="a">
	<li><i>wp(S, False) = False</i> is impossible. True/False? Explain.
	<li><i>wp(S, True ) = False</i> defines liveness of S.
	  True/False? Explain.
	<li> Compute <i>wp(S, m = y)</i>, where S is 
	<tt>if x >= y -> m := x [] x <= y -> m := y fi</tt>

      <li>A scheduling policy that is strongly fair must also be weakly fair.
	Discuss.

      <li>Consider the program segment given below.
	Let <i>P</i> be a predicate that characterizes the weakest
	deadlock-free precondition for the program, i.e., the largest
	set of states such that, if the program is begun in a state
	satisfying <i>P</i>, then it will terminate if scheduling is
	weakly-fair. Determine <i>P</i>.  Explain how you arrived at P.
<pre>
co < await x >= 3 -> x := x - 1 >
|| < await x >= 2 -> x := x - 1 >
|| < await x == 1 -> x := x + 5 >
oc</pre>

      <li>Since the semantics of <tt>S1 || S2</tt> permits their
	execution as if it is <tt>S1;S2</tt>, we can replace some
	occurrences, if not all, of <tt>S1;S2</tt> with <tt>S1 ||
	S2</tt>.  True/False? Explain.

      <li>The code <code>V(s); P(s)</code> is <i>always</i> equivalent
      to a no-op (&quot;skip&quot;, or do-nothing).  True/False? Explain.

      <li>
	``Every philosopher will eventually get hungry.'' is a safety,
	not liveness, property.  True/False? Explain.


      <li>In the context of RPC, a procedure designed to be called remotely
	<i>can</i> use global variables to communicate with the
	caller, provided we modify <i>rpcgen</i> appropriately.
	True/False? Explain.

      <li>Marshalling in RPC is no more than a tight-packing of the
	bytes of the input arguments. True/False? Explain.
    </ol>
  </li>
  

<li>(30 points) The <i><it>Recursive Data Representation: Small Set of
      Integers</it></i> of Hoare's CSP paper is reproduced below. (a)
      (20 points) Extend it to respond to a
      request <tt>S(1)!count()</tt> from S(0) that expects a reply
      with the number of elements in the set.  (b) (10 points) Include
      a convincing argument that your extension is correct, and that
      you have not broken existing functionality.
  <blockquote>  <pre>
    S(i: 1 .. 100) ::
    do  n: integer; S(i-1)?has(n) -> S(0)!false
    []  n: integer; S(i-1)?insert(n) ->
        do  m: integer; S(i-1)?has(m) ->
            if  m <= n -> S(0)!(m = n)
            []  m >  n -> S(i+1)!has(m)
            fi
        []  m: integer; S(i-1)?insert(m) ->
            if m < n -> S(i+1)!insert(n); n := m
            [] m = n ->  skip
            [] m > n -> S(i+1)!insert(m)
	    fi
        od
    od</pre>  </blockquote>
</li>

<li>(20 points) Consider the following as an <b>await</b>-statement
  based solution of the classic Producer/Consumer Problem where the
  producer invokes deposit(item) to deposit an item into the buffer
  buf[] of size n and consumer invokes fetch() to retrieve an item.

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">    <pre>
    deposit(item) {
      < await count < n ->
          buf[rear] := item;
          rear := rear mod n + 1;
          count := count + 1;
      >
    }
	  </pre>
      </td>
      <td valign="top"><pre>
    fetch() {
        < await count > 0 ->
            item := buf[front];
	    front := front mod n + 1;
	    count := count - 1;
	>
	return item;
    }
     </pre>

</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <ol type="a">
    <li> (5 points) What are the correct initial values for <tt>count, rear</tt> and
	<tt>front </tt>?
    <li>(15 points) Using the Pass-the-Baton technique systematically
      convert the above methods to equivalent methods using
      semaphores only.
  </ol>
</li>
