  <li>(12*5 points) In the  following, it is <i>possible</i> to write no more
    than, say, ten, sentences each, and yet receive full score.  Explain/
    discuss/ dispute/ compute/ prove. 
    <ol type="i">
      <li>There are examples of safety properties that are also liveness
        properties.</li>
      <li>Detection of termination is difficult only in peer-to-peer
        distributed computing not in client-server computing.</li>
      <li>Construct the ssend(B, msg) and srecv(B, msg) primitives of
        synchronous message passing from asend(B, msg) and arecv(B, msg)
        primitives of asynchronous message passing.</li>
      <li>Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading of
        asynchronous message passing because token-passing does not make sense
        under synchronous message passing.</li>
      <li>The <i>happened before</i> relation, as discussed, requires a logical
        clock for every process.  But  a typical machine (node) in a
        distributed system runs several processes. It is sufficient to maintain
        a logical clock per node that is shared by all processes running on
        that node.</li>
      <li>Reconstruct the binary "tree" serialized below. List each node as a
        triplet of (info integer, left-link and right-link), as usual.  The
        first digit in the sequence is the offset of the root node.<br>
        <code>marshaled sequence: 2 1 4 2 6 3 4 9 4 0 2 9 9<br>
        offsets in hex:     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D</code></li>
      <li>Does the precondition and statement {x  &ge; 4} &lt; x := x - 4 &gt;
        interfere with the triple<br>
        {x is odd} &lt; x := x + 5 &gt; {x is even}.</li>
      <li>Using the technique of weakened assertions, prove that {x = 0} S {x =
        9} is a theorem, where S is<br>
        co &lt;x := x+2&gt; || &lt;x := x+3&gt; || &lt;x := x+4&gt; oc </li>
      <li>Explain the Receive Axiom: {P} receive ch(vars) {Q}.</li>
      <li>Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the truly
        distributed context.</li>
      <li>A solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem can be used to
        build semaphores in a distributed system, and vice versa.</li>
      <li>Explain, with an example, the map/reduce idea behind Hadoop.</li>
    </ol>

  <li>(10+15+15 points) Given a large (in the zillions) bag B of integers, find
    the fourth largest number in B.  Assume that B has at least four distinct
    integers. Two solutions, one in CSP and another in C-Linda are to be
    developed.  It is not required that both use the same "idea."  Present your
    solutions with full explanations. 
    <ol type="i">
      <li>As usual, (i) we wish to maximize concurrency, (ii) we prefer a
        symmetric solution, (iii) we rate correctness much higher than
        efficiency, and cannot tolerate (iv) deadlocks or (v) livelocks. 
        Defend <i>why for each of these five.</i> </li>
      <li>For C-Linda, assume that the tuple space already contains the bag of
        integers <code>&lt;"B", n&gt;</code>, the size of this bag
        <code>&lt;"BSZ", bsz&gt;, and &lt;"p", p&gt; the</code> number of
        worker processes.. You lose 5 points for each use of <code>inp</code>
        or <code>rdp</code>. </li>
      <li>For CSP, the bag is generated by process B whose structure is <code>B
        :: *[ ... --&gt; P!n ]</code>.  Develop the process P and appropriately
        chosen other processes.</li>
