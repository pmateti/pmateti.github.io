   (5*5 points) The following statements may or may not be (fully or partially) 
   valid.&nbsp; <i>First</i>, explain the technical terms occurring in the 
   statement.&nbsp; <i>Then</i>, explain/ discuss/ dispute the statement.&nbsp; 
   It is <i>possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten, sentences each, and 
   yet receive full score.

      The property&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>``Some day, if not at the end of CEG 730, 
      you will appreciate and marvel at the book Concurrent Programming by 
      Andrews.''</i>&nbsp; is neither a safety, nor a liveness property.<li>The 
     CSP code<tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;[X!2 || Y!3]&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>is equivalent to<br>
     &nbsp;<tt>&nbsp; [true -&gt; X!2; Y!3 [] true -&gt; Y!3; X!2]</tt></li>
     <li>
      Every client/server program is based on RPC (-like) mechanism.<li>
      Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading of 
      ``asynchronous message passing'' because token-passing does not make sense 
      under synchronous message passing.<li>
      A typical machine (node) in a distributed system can run several 
      concurrent processes. Each of these processes must maintain its own 
      logical clock in order to correctly deal with the <i>happened before</i><b>
      </b>relation.</ol>
  <li>(5*5 points)
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the truly 
    distributed context. </li>
    <li>Describe the distributed implementation of semaphore of our text book.
    </li>
    <li>There are numerous ACK messages being sent.&nbsp; Discuss if any or all of 
    these are unnecessary. </li>
    <li>Does it implement a weak, strong (or neither) semaphore? </li>
    <li>Can any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem be thought 
    of as a solution to the problem of implementing semaphores in a distributed 
    system, and vice versa.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(5*10 points) In a bag <i>B</i> of&nbsp; <i>b</i> integers, it is known 
  that each element appears exactly <i>d</i> times. We wish to delete the 
  duplicates resulting in a set of only <i>b/d</i> distinct integers that 
  occurred in the bag. It is guaranteed that <i>d &gt; 0, b &gt; 0</i>. Unfortunately, 
  the value <i>d</i> is unavailable and needs to be computed by examining the 
  bag B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two solutions, one in CSP and another in C-Linda are to be 
  developed.&nbsp; It is not required that both use the same &quot;idea.&quot;&nbsp; You 
  are expected to present your design and implementation with full explanations.&nbsp; 
  As usual, we wish to maximize concurrency, we prefer a symmetric solution, and 
  we rate correctness much higher than efficiency.&nbsp;
  <ul>
    <li>(a) Design&nbsp; and (b) implement a solution in C-Linda. Assume that 
    the tuple space already contains <tt>&lt;&quot;B&quot;, x<sub>i</sub>&gt; </tt>for all <tt>x<sub>i</sub></tt> 
    in B, and the size of the bag <tt>&lt;&quot;b&quot;, b&gt;</tt>. You lose 5 points for each 
    use of <tt>inp</tt> or <tt>rdp</tt>. </li>
    <li>(c) Design and (d) implement a solution in CSP. Assume that the bag is 
    already distributed, one element per process.&nbsp; Thus, there are <i>b</i> 
    processes, each with exactly one element.&nbsp; After the algorithm 
    terminates, some of these processes will be &quot;empty handed.&quot; </li>
    <li>(e) Defend <i>why</i> we wish to maximize concurrency,&nbsp; <i>why</i> 
    we prefer a symmetric solution, and&nbsp; <i>why</i> we rate correctness 
    much higher than efficiency.</li>
