<blockquote> <p>This take-home exam permits the use of a Linux/Windows
laptop/PC running javac, g++, scala, Eclipse, Idea, and other software
development and drawing tools.  <i style="color: brown;
background-color: yellow">You are welcome to refer to your notes in a
way equivalent to using a simple cheatsheet to solely help you only to
remember the syntax of the various notations and langauges.</i> It is
otherwise a traditional closed book, closed notes exam.  In
particular, you are honor bound <i>*not*</i> to Internet surf or
access any content already existing (other than as indicated) once you
access the final until you turnin the answers.  The primary reasons in
making this a take-home are to relieve time pressure and give you a
comfortable (computing/home) environment.  Do not give or take help
from others.

<ol>

  <li>(5 * 8 points) The following statements may or may not be
  (fully or partially) valid.  Explain the underlined technical
  terms</i> occurring in each statement.  Explain/ discuss/ dispute
  the statement.  It is <i>possible</i> to write no more than, say,
  five, lines each, and yet receive full score.

  <ol type=i>

    <li>A &quot;safety'' property is defined thus: Let&nbsp;
    <b>bad</b> be a predicate characterizing a "bad" state of program
    code segment S.  Assume that <u>{P} S {Q}</u> holds. Assume that I is a
    global <u>invariant</u>. If I implies the&nbsp; negation of <b>bad</b>,
    we say that <b>not bad </b>is a safety property for S. Thus, it
    all depends on whether&nbsp; <i>we consider a certain property
    good or bad.</i></li>

    <li>In a collection of <u>semaphores</u> that constitutes a
    <u>split binary semaphore</u>, at least one of them must be 1.

    <li>The happened before relation, as discussed, requires a logical
    clock for every process.  But a typical machine (node) in a
    distributed system runs several processes.  So, it is sufficient
    to maintain a logical clock per node that is shared by all
    processes running on that node.

    <li>In the context of our <u>distributed semaphore</u>
    implementation, not all <u>fully acknowledged</u> messages are
    necessary.

    <li><u>Detection of termination</u> is difficult only in
    <u>peer-to-peer</u> distributed computing not in client-server
    computing.


    <li>RPC/RMI based solutions are <u>distributed</u>, but not
    <u>parallel</u>.

    <li> We wish to maximize (a) <u>concurrency</u>, we prefer (b)
    <u>symmetric solutions</u>, we rate (c) correctness much
    higher than efficiency, and cannot tolerate (d) deadlocks
    or (e) livelocks.   Defend <i>why</i> for each of
    these five.

    <li> "A distributed system is one in which the failure of a
    computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer
    unusable." Is this a good definition?

  </ol>

  <li>(20 * 3 points)

  <ol type="i">

      <li> Using the technique of weakened assertions, prove that
        <code>{x = 0} S {x = 9}</code> is a theorem. S is <code>var x
        := 0; co &lsaquo;x += 2&rsaquo; || &lsaquo;x += 3&rsaquo;
        || &lsaquo;x += 4&rsaquo; oc</code>

    <li>    <table><tr>
      <td width=26% valign=top>

        <sr>
        int x := 0; int y := 0;<br>
        do  true &rarr;  x := x + 1 ;<br>

        od</sr>
      </td>
      <td width=75% valign=top>

        Consider the code block at left.  Do any of the
        temporal assertions<br>
                  
        (a) (5 points) always x = 0<br>
        (b) (5 points) eventually x > 5<br>
        (c) (10 points) eventually always y = 3<br>
        hold?  Where? When?  How? Under weakly fair scheduling?
      </td></tr></table></li>

      <li>Implement the standard Producer/ Conumers example in Scala
      using Akka Actors.  Use either become or FSM or neither.  You
      may want (but not required) to see an implementation using
      threads and synchronize: <a
      href="./bounded-buffers-with-threads.scala.html">
      bounded-buffers-with-threads.scala</a>.  The solution to this
      question is to replace the threads with actors.  Feel free to
      use (or ignore) portions of this source code.  Submit your file
      of Scala code as a separate file named <code>
      bounded-buffers-with-actors.scala</code>

<li> (0 points) [For survey purposes only.] Please record your
effort in minutes for each of the above items.  Other feedback you
wish to give is also welcome.
