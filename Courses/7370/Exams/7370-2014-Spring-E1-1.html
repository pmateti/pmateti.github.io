      <p>This take-home exam permits the use of a Linux/Windows
	laptop/PC running javac, g++, Eclipse, Idea, and other
	software development and drawing tools.  It is otherwise a
	traditional closed book, closed notes exam.  In particular,
	you are honor bound <i>*not*</i> to Internet surf or access any
	content already existing (other than as indicated) once you
	access the final until you turnin the answers.  The primary
	reasons in making this a take-home are to relieve time pressure
	and give you a comfortable (computing/home) environment.  Do
	not give or take help from others.

      <p>Submit your answers 
        on <code>thor.cs.wright.edu</code>
        using <code>~pmateti/ceg7370/turnin MT answers.pdf</code>

	(fully or partially) valid.  Explain the underlined technical
	terms</i> occurring in each statement.  Explain/ discuss/
	dispute the statement.  It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
	than, say, five, lines each, and yet receive full score.

          <li> The semantics of the fat-bar operator []
	  permits us to equivalently replace S1 [] S2 with simply S1.

          <li> ``Every philosopher will eventually get hungry.'' is a
	  safety, not liveness, property.

          <li><i>Asynchronous</i> message passing is more fundamental
          than <i>synchronous</i> message passing.

        <li> In the distributed programming context, <code>P(m);
        Critical-Section; V(m)</code> is not starvation-free.  Give a
        detailed starvation scenario.  What does Morris' algorithm to
        eliminate this scenario?
          
        <li> Construct the ssend(pid, msg) and srecv(pid, msg)
        primitives of synchronous message passing from asend(pid, msg)
        and arecv(pid, msg) primitives of asynchronous message
        passing.

        <li>Reconstruct the binary &quot;tree&quot; serialized
	    below. List each node as a triplet of (info integer,
	    left-link and right-link), as usual.&nbsp; The first digit
	    in the sequence is the offset of the root node.<br>

          <li>The <i><it>Recursive Data Representation: Small Set of
          Integers</it></i> of Hoare's CSP paper is reproduced below.
          Extend it to respond to a
          command <tt>S(1)!remove(x)</tt> from S(0) that removes x from
          the set, if it contains it, and does nothing if it does not.

        <li>In a bag <i>B</i> of <i>b</i> integers, it is known that
              each element appears exactly <i>4</i> times.  We wish to
              delete the duplicates resulting in a set of only
              <i>b/4</i> distinct integers that occurred in the bag.
              Design, and implement a solution in C/Java-Linda.
              Assume that the tuple space already contains
              <tt>&lt;&quot;B&quot;, x<sub>i</sub>&gt; </tt>for all
              <tt>x<sub>i</sub></tt> in B, and the size of the bag

              each use of <tt>inp</tt> or <tt>rdp</tt>.  You are
              expected to present your design and implementation
              <i>with full explanations</i>.  As usual, we wish to
              maximize concurrency, we prefer a symmetric solution,
              and we must have correctness, we must not have deadlocks
              or livelocks.  </li>
