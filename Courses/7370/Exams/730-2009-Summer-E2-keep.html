  <li> (8*5 points) The following statements may or may not be (fully
or partially) valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain/ discuss/
dispute the statement.&nbsp; It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
than, say, ten, sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    <ol type="a">
      <li> There are examples of safety properties that are liveness
properties.</li>
      <li>Detection of termination is difficult only in peer-to-peer distributed 
      computing not in client-server computing.</li>
      <li> Every client-server program is based on RPC (-like)
mechanism.</li>
      <li> Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading of
``asynchronous message passing'' because token-passing does not make
sense under synchronous message passing.</li>
      <li> The <i>happened
before</i><b> </b>relation, as discussed, requires a logical clock for every 
      process.&nbsp; But&nbsp; a typical machine (node) in a distributed system 
      runs several processes. It is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per 
      node that is shared by all processes running on that node.</li>
		<li> TBD</li>
		<li> TBD</li>
		<li> Does the precondition and statement {x&nbsp; &ge; 4 } &lt; x := x - 4 
		&gt; interfere with the triple<br>
		{ x is odd } &lt; x := x + 5 &gt; {x is even }.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(10+10 points) It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
than, say, ten, sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the
truly distributed context. </li>
      <li>Discuss if all of the ACKs are necessary. </li>
      <li>Can any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem
be thought of as a solution to the problem of implementing semaphores
in a distributed system, and vice versa.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(40 points) You are given a large (in the zillions) bag B of pairs (c, m) 
	where c is a lower case letter and m is an integer. &nbsp; We would like to 
	sum up the numbers m corresponding to each of the letters c.&nbsp; That is, 
	we would like to reduce B to a set S of letter-number pairs (d, n), where d 
	is a letter that has appeared in a pair of B, and n is the sum of the 
	corresponding numbers m that were paired with d.&nbsp; No two pairs of S 
	have the same letter d.&nbsp; Every letter that appeared in a pair of B also 
	appears in a pair of S. Two solutions,
one in CSP and another in C-Linda are to be developed.&nbsp; It is not
required that both use the same "idea."&nbsp; Present your solutions with full explanations.&nbsp;
	<br>
	(a) (10 points) As usual, (i) we wish to maximize 
  concurrency, (ii) we prefer a symmetric solution, (iii) we rate correctness much higher 
  than efficiency, and cannot tolerate (iv) deadlocks or (v) livelocks.&nbsp; 
	Defend <i>why for each of these five.</i><br>(a) (15 points) For C-Linda, assume that the tuple 
	space already contains the <tt>&lt;"c&quot;, c, m&gt;</tt>, and the size of this
bag <tt>&lt;"bsz", bsz&gt;</tt>. You lose 5 points for each use of <tt>inp</tt>
or <tt>rdp</tt>.&nbsp; Use an appropriately chosen number of processes.<br>(b) 
	(15 points) For CSP, the bag is generated by 
  process B whose structure is <code>B :: *[ ... --&gt; P!(c, m) ]</code>.&nbsp; Develop the process 
	P and an appropriately chosen other processes.</li>
