      <p>This take-home exam permits the use of a Linux/Windows
	laptop/PC running javac, g++, Eclipse, Idea, and other
	software development and drawing tools.  It is otherwise a
	traditional closed book, closed notes exam.  In particular,
	you are honor bound <i>*not*</i> to Internet surf or access any
	content already existing (other than as indicated) once you
	access the exam until you turnin the answers.  The primary
	reasons in making this a take-home are to relieve time pressure
	and give you a comfortable (computing/home) environment.  Do
	not give or take help from others.

      <p>Submit your answers.pdf 
        as an email attachment to me.
