or partially) valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain the <i>italicized</i> terms. Discuss/
dispute the statement.&nbsp; It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
than, say, five thoughtful sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Every<i> distributed system</i> must also be a <i>concurrent system</i>.</li>
      <li> <i>Asynchronous</i>&nbsp; message passing is more fundamental than <i>
      synchronous</i> message passing.</li>
      <li> 
		<p align="justify"> <i>Token-passing </i>algorithms were discussed under the heading of&nbsp; asynchronous message passing because token-passing does not make
sense under synchronous message passing.</li>
      <li> 
		<p align="justify">The <i>happened
before</i><b> </b>relation, as in the book, requires a logical clock for every 
      process.&nbsp; But&nbsp; a typical machine (node) in a distributed system 
      runs several processes. It is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per 
      node that is shared by all processes running on that node.</li>
		<li> Peer-to-peer distributed computing is just an academic 
		term for the commercial term client-server computing.</li>
		<li> The CSP code<tt> [X!2 || Y!3]&nbsp;</tt>is equivalent to<tt><br>
		[true -&gt; 
		X!2; Y!3 [] true -&gt; Y!3; X!2]</tt><br>

  <li>(4*5 points) It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
than, say, five thoughtful sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the truly 
		distributed context. </li>
		<li>Discuss if all of the ACKs are necessary in the solution discussed 
		in the lectures.</li>
		<li>Discuss if any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem 
		can be thought of as a solution to the problem of implementing semaphores in 
		a distributed system, and vice versa.</li>

	<p align="justify">(10+20+20 points) In a <i>bag</i> <i>B</i> of&nbsp;integers, 
	it is known that each element appears exactly <i>d</i> times, <i>d &gt; 0</i>. 
	We wish to delete the duplicates resulting in a <i>set</i> of distinct 
	integers that occurred in the bag. Two solutions, one in CSP and another in 
	C-Linda are to be developed.&nbsp; It is <i>not</i> required that both use the 
	same &quot;idea.&quot;&nbsp; You are expected to present your design and implementation 
	with full explanations.&nbsp; As usual, we wish to maximize concurrency, we 
	prefer a symmetric solution, we rate correctness much higher than 
	efficiency, and cannot tolerate deadlocks or livelocks.

  		[Linda]&nbsp; Assume that the tuple space already contains all the 
		elements <tt>&lt;"B&quot;, e&gt;</tt> 
  of <i>B</i>, and the size of this
bag <tt>&lt;"bsz", b&gt;</tt>. Unfortunately, the value <i>d</i> is unavailable and 
		needs to be computed by examining the bag <i>B</i>. Fully explain (10 points) your 
		Linda solution design&nbsp; in English/pseudo-code and 
	on a <u>fresh page</u> implement&nbsp; (10 points) it in C-Linda. You lose 2 points 
		for each 
		use of <tt>inp</tt>
or <tt>rdp. </tt>However, the problem may require their use.</li>
		<li>
		<p align="justify">(10 + 10 points) [CSP]&nbsp; The bag <i>B</i> is now generated by 
  		a process Q, which outputs <code>P!(&quot;dup&quot;, d)</code> and then does <code>*[ ... --&gt; P!(&quot;B&quot;, 
		e) ]</code>. Do not assume that Q generates <code>d</code> duplicates 
		before moving on to the next integer. Develop the process 
  P and 
  any others you wish to have. Fully explain &nbsp;(10 points) your CSP solution design in 
		English/pseudo-code.&nbsp; Implement&nbsp; (10 points) 
  on a <u>fresh page</u> the design in CSP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
