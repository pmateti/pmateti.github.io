  <li> (5*5 points) The following statements may or may not be (fully
or partially) valid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain/ discuss/
dispute the statement.&nbsp; It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
than, say, ten, sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    <ol type="a">
      <li> There are examples of safety properties that are liveness
properties.</li>
      <li>Detection of termination is difficult only in peer-to-peer distributed 
      computing not in client-server computing.</li>
      <li> Every client-server program is based on RPC (-like)
mechanism.</li>
      <li> Token-passing algorithms were discussed under the heading of
``asynchronous message passing'' because token-passing does not make
sense under synchronous message passing.</li>
      <li> The <i>happened
before</i><b> </b>relation, as discussed, requires a logical clock for every 
      process.&nbsp; But&nbsp; a typical machine (node) in a distributed system 
      runs several processes. It is sufficient to maintain a logical clock per 
      node that is shared by all processes running on that node.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(10+10+5 points) It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
than, say, ten, sentences each, and yet receive full score.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Discuss why it is difficult to implement a semaphore in the
truly distributed context. </li>
      <li>Discuss if all of the ACKs are necessary. </li>
      <li>Can any solution to the distributed mutual exclusion problem
be thought of as a solution to the problem of implementing semaphores
in a distributed system, and vice versa.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(5*10 points) You are given a large (in the millions) bag of triplets of 
  unsigned integers (x, y, d).&nbsp; Each triplet represents a horizontal line 
  segment of length d in the Euclidean plane whose left end point is at (x, y).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Two triplets (x1, y1, d1) and (x2, y2, d2) are said to be <i>connected</i> if&nbsp; 
  y1 == y2 and either x1 + d1 == x2 or x2 + d2 == x1.&nbsp; A triplet (x1, y1, 
  d1) <i>contains</i> (x2, y2, d2) if y1 == y2 and x1 &lt;= x2 and x1 + d1 &gt;= x2 + 
  d2.&nbsp; We would like to minimize the size (== number of triplets) of&nbsp; 
  the given bag of triplets so that every original triplet is contained in some 
  triplet in the resulting collection.&nbsp; Two solutions,
one in CSP and another in C-Linda are to be developed.&nbsp; It is not
required that both use the same "idea."&nbsp; Present your design and implementation 
  separately, each with full explanations.&nbsp; As usual, we wish to maximize 
  concurrency, we prefer a symmetric solution, we rate correctness much higher 
  than efficiency, and cannot tolerate deadlocks or livelocks.<br>
  (a) Design&nbsp; and (b) implement a solution in C-Linda.
Assume that the tuple space already contains the triplets <tt>&lt;"t&quot;, x, y, d&gt;</tt>, and the size of this
bag <tt>&lt;"sz", N&gt;</tt>. You lose 5 points for each use of <tt>inp</tt>
or <tt>rdp</tt>. <br>
  (c) Design and (d) implement a solution in CSP.&nbsp; The bag is generated by 
  process A whose structure is <br>
  <code>A :: *[ ... --&gt; B!(x, y, d) ]</code>.&nbsp; Develop the process B and 
  any others.<br>
  (e) Defend <i>why</i> we wish to maximize concurrency,&nbsp;
        <i>why</i> we prefer a symmetric solution, and&nbsp; <i>why</i>
we rate correctness much higher than efficiency.</li>
