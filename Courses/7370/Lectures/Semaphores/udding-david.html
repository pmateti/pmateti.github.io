Udding's solution as presented in his paper and in our class is
correct (i.e., starvation-free). However, Udding's wording of what

<h2>Udding's Weak Semaphore Assumption</h2>

<p>
"A semaphore is called weak if absence of individual starvation among
processes blocked at that semaphore cannot be guaranteed. For weak
semaphores, one assumption is made, however, viz. (S1) a process that
executes a V-operation on a semaphore will not be the one to perform
the NEXT P-operation on that semaphore, if a process has been blocked
at that semaphore. (S2) One of the waiting processes is allowed to pass
that semaphore."  We will call it UDWS.

<p>The problem is that UDWS can be easily misinterpreted.  Udding's
assumption consists of two sentences as marked above.

<p>Interpretation A: If we interpret S2 as "One of the waiting
processes will be chosen whenever a V operation is executed and will
be the next one to pass the semaphore" then S1 is redundant. Since the
process to perform the next P operation has already been chosen from
the waiting ones it is obviously not the process that just performed
the V operation. This interpretation is equivalent to Morris' and I
actually think this is what Udding meant.  The fact that the first
sentence is there may cause the reader to neglect the second sentence.

<p>Interpretation B: We can also interpret the "is allowed to pass" of
S2 as "waiting processes may pass (or permitted to pass) from now on,
but they don't necessarily have to".  Now S1 is obviously not
redundant, since it imposes a restriction not implied by S2.  Under
this interpretation starvation can occur. This interpretation is not
equivalent to Morris' assumption.  This one looks much more appealing,
but should no be chosen, because we can have the scenario described
below.


<h2>Example Bad Scenario</h2>

  Imagine
  we have processes P1, P2, and P3.


<ol>
<li>
To help explain, we will draw a timeline of PV-operations of all
the processes.
<pre>
ne=0, nm=0    eu=1           qu=0                          mu=0
--------------1--------------2----------3--------------------a------
P1, P2, P3 at 1
</pre>

<li>
<p>Suppose P1 executes all of line 1. Further suppose, it also
executes P(qu) in line 2. P1 cannot execute 3:P(eu) [because of UDWS]
and therefore it waits at the beginning of line 3.  We stll have P2,
P3 waiting at 1:P(eu).

<pre>
ne=1, nm=0    eu=1           qu=0                          mu=0
--------------1--------------2----------3--------------------a------
                P1             P1     P1
        P2, P3
</pre>


<li>

<p>Let P2 execute line 1. It waits at the beginning of line 2 since qu
= 0.

<pre>
ne=2, nm=0    eu=1           qu=0                          mu=0
--------------1--------------2--------3--------------------a------
                P1             P1   P1
                P2         P2
            P3
</pre>

<li>
P1 is no longer the last one to do a V(eu); P1 is now enabled to
complete 3:P(eu).  In order to illustrate Udding' weakness, we (the
system) choose to let P1 execute lines 3, 4, and 5.  Now ne = 1, P1
executes 6:V(eu), 9:V(qu). P1 waits at a:P(mu), since mu = 0.  We now
have P2 waiting at 2:P(qu), P3 waiting at 1:P(eu).

<pre>
ne=1, nm=1    eu=1           qu=1                          mu=0
--------------1--------------2--------3--------------------a------
                P1             P1       P1               P1
                P2         P2
            P3
</pre>

<li>
We choose to let P2 execute line 2.  We now have: P1 is waiting at
a:P(mu).  P2 is waiting at 3:P(eu). P3 is waiting at 1:P(eu).

<pre>
ne=1, nm=1    eu=1           qu=0                          mu=0
--------------1--------------2--------3--------------------a------
                P1             P1       P1               P1
                P2             P2   P2
            P3
</pre>


<li>
Among the two processes waiting on P(eu), UDWS does not compel us to
choose P3 over P2.  (If we want to prevent starvation, it should do
so.)  We let P2 complete 3:P(eu).

<p>Let P2 continue through lines 4 and 5. When P2 arrives at line 6,
ne = 0, so P2 executes 7:V(mu), and 9: V(qu).  We now have: P1, P2 are
waiting at a:P(mu).  P3 is waiting at 1:P(eu).  No process is waiting
on qu.

<pre>
ne=0, nm=2    eu=0           qu=1                          mu=1
--------------1--------------2--------3--------------------a------
                P1             P1       P1               P1
                P2             P2       P2               P2
            P3
</pre>

<li>P1 and P2 can now proceed, in either order, into the Critical
  Section while P3 waits at 1:P(eu).  After P1 and P2 finish executing
  the Critical Section, suppose they go back to line 1.  We have the
  same initial situation: P1, P2, P3, are waiting at 1:P(eu).  P1 and
  P2 can repeat again the process described. (If P2 executes the last
  V(eu) operation, P1 can start the firs P(eu); if P1 executes the
  last V(eu), we can repeat exactly the process described with P2 in
  the place of P1 and P1 in the place of P2) P3 gets starved.

</ol>

<h2>Morris' Assumption</h2>


<p>
Morris states his assumption (MDWS) for weak semaphores as follows:
"If any process is waiting to complete a P(s) operation, and
another process performs a V(s), the semaphore is not incremented, and
one of the waiting processes completes its P(s)."</p>


<p>Execution of 7:V(mu) (see item 6 above) does not happen under MDWS.
The moment P1 executes the 6:V(eu) (item 4 above) one of the processes
waiting at 1:P(eu) completes it and increment ne.

<p>In fact the execution would be different from way earlier. Strictly
following MDWS, right after P1 has performed the 1:V(eu), one of the
other processes has to perform the P(eu) operation. This will occur
again when any other process finishes the line or executes a V(eu)
operation, and if there are processes waiting at the beginning of line
1 they will sequentially execute P(eu). Starvation does not occur
under Morris' definition.

<h2>Mark Ijbema's MS Thesis</h2>

<p>Section 3.2 of Mark Ijbema is especially interesting in this
discussion. It compares both assumptions and concludes that:

<p>"This [Udding's assumption] is only marginally weaker [Morris'
assumption], because the only difference is when the elected process
makes the step into the guarded zone. In Udding's version this might
be postponed until the elected process is scheduled again, instead of
immediately. On first reading Udding's definition seems much weaker,
because of the (redundant) first sentence. An interesting question is
whether the algorithms would still be correct without the second
sentence, that is, only demanding that the last process to execute the
V operation cannot be the first to execute the P operation, if already
processes were waiting. We look further into this question in appendix
C."

<p>The "(redundant)" was very important for me to understand the problem.

<p>In Appendix C, we have the above situation described (for the
second time).  Based on this, Ijbema explains why
<i>buffered semaphores</i> (defined by Ijbema) need to be used instead
of <i>polite semaphores</i> (extensively explained in the
thesis). Essentially polite semaphores only enforce one restriction:
The process that executed the last V does not execute the next P. They
only imply the first sentence of Udding's assumption. Buffered
semaphores actually choose a new process when a V operation is
executed from the waiting ones that will be the only one continuing
its execution. The process "chosen" need not perform the P operation
right away, but it is the only one to finish the P-operation. Buffered
semaphores implement the second sentence of Udding's assumption under
Interpretation A.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Udding is essentially right both in his solution and assumption,
but the phrasing of the weak semaphore assumption should be improved.
