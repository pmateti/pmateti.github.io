  <h1>Safety and Liveness</h1>

  <p>
    A ``safety'' property is defined thus: Let BAD be a predicate
    characterizing any arbitrary condition or state of program code
    segment S that you consider is ``bad''.  Assume that {P} S {Q}
    holds.  Assume that I is a {global invariant}.  If I &rArr; 
    $\neg$ BAD, we say that $\neg$ BAD is a safety property
    for S.

  <p>
    Our Andrews' text book unfortunately uses the subjective words
    "good" and "bad" in defining Safety and Liveness.  Instead think
    of (i) safety as a property that is true from the beginning of the
    process to its end of life, and (ii) liveness as a property that
    will become true at a future moment in time, perhaps just once or
    many many times.  So, safety is an invariant property -- good or
    bad subjectively.  Obviously, in a real enough context, we do not
    want a "bad" thing to ever happen, i.e., not-bad should be true at
    all times.

<ol class=o>
<li><h2>Safety examples</h2>


<ol>

<li>
Variable x is always non-negative.
<li>
Two processes are never in their critical sections.
<li>
A message is received only after it is sent.
<li>
No sent message is lost.
<li>
A philosopher remains hungry until it eats.
</ol>

<li>
<h2>Liveness examples</h2>

<ol>


<li>
Variable x will become divisible by 7.
<li>
Even in the presence of contentions, one of the processes will enter
its critical section.
<li>
A sent message is eventually received.
<li>
A philosopher will eat.

</ol>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ol>

  <li>
    ``Every philosopher will eventually get hungry.'' is a safety, not
    liveness, property. True/False? Explain.

  <li>
    A safety property states that nothing ``bad'' will ever happen,
    whereas a liveness property states that something ``good'' will
    happen in the next minute.


  <li>
    Often there is no difference between safety and liveness properties.


  <li>The negation of a safety property is a liveness property.


  <li>"Some day, if not at the end of CEG 7370, you will appreciate
    and marvel at the book Concurrent Programming by Andrews."
    Explain if this is a safety, or liveness property, or perhaps
    neither.</li>
