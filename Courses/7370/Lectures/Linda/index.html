CEG 7370: Distributed Computing Principles</a></h3>
<h1>Linda <a href="../Linda/matetiLinda.pptx">slides</a> and a Few Exercises
</h1>

<h3>Prabhaker Mateti</h3>

<p>This page contains a few examples of distributed computing done in
Linda</a>.  Our focus is not on time or space complexity, but on the
more qualitative issues.  The solutions can easily be improved.  A few
times I chose to 'describe' in English rather than write pseudo-code
in order to explain the ideas.  I am sure you can all fill-in the
details and code it in whatever-Linda.  Not all solutions are
complete.

<p>Most of the difficulty is in discovering a solution outline
suitable for Linda, i.e., with many processes, with almost no
synchronization.  Message passing, and shared memory are easy in
Linda.  Since this is your first exposure to Linda, efficiency is
relatively unimportant, but correctness must be preserved at all
costs.

<p>Any C code can be embedded in C-linda.  So, it is important that
you don't just write a C program using Linda primitives just to claim
that you did.  Also, recall the CEG 7370 restrictions mentioned in the
slides.

<p>
Typography: Tuples are written preferably as parenthesized; some
examples below use angular brackets.

<p>
There several prime number generators referred to in CEG 7370.  Recall
the Eratosthenes Sieve done in CSP.

<h2>Bag to Set Conversion</h2>

<p>
  In a bag <i>B</i> of <i>nb</i> integers, it is known that each
  element appears exactly <i>d</i> times. We wish to delete the
  duplicates resulting in a set of only <i>nb/d</i> distinct integers
  that occurred in the bag. It is guaranteed that <i>d &gt; 0, nb &gt;
  0</i>. Unfortunately, the value <i>d</i> is unavailable and needs to
  be computed by examining the bag B.   Design  and
  implement a solution in C-Linda. Assume that the tuple space already
  contains <tt>("B", x<sub>i</sub>)</tt>for
  all <tt>x<sub>i</sub></tt> in B, and the size of the
  bag <tt>("BSZ", nb)</tt>. You lose 5 points for each
  use of <tt>inp</tt> or <tt>rdp</tt>.

<p>Solution Outline only.

<p>
Bag Element == ("B", e).
Set Element == ("S", e).

<p>
1. The number of duplicates d is not given.  We must compute it.  Do
<tt>in("B", ?x)</tt> once in the main process.  Then in a loop do
<tt>inp("B", x)</tt> until it fails.  This gives the count d.  We will out("S",
x) at the end -- not now. Lost 5 points :-(

<p>2. Number of workers to use is not specified.  We choose p.  E.g.,
let p be about <i>nb/1000</i> assuming bsz is in the millions.  Each
worker will process <i>(nb -- d) / p</i> bag elements.  We make sure
that rounding this number is such that all elements are processed.

<p>3.  Main process does an <tt>out("S", x)</tt>.

<li>
<h2>Sum Up a Bag of Numbers</h2>

<p>
Given a finite bag B of numbers and the size nb of the bag B, find the
sum of all numbers in B.

<p>Linda problems should first try result-parallelism. If we have p
processes, each should sum up nb/p numbers and leave the result in the
TS.

<p>The p was to be our choice. To chose p=nb/2 seems good, but what
about the next "iteration"? That is after nb/2 processes each added a
pair of numbers, what should these nb/2 processes do? Terminate? Half
of them should. The other half (now nb/4 in number) repeat this
computation. Eventually we should one process adding 2 numbers.

<p>What if nb is not a power of 2? Pad the bag with extra zeros.

<p>How do we decide which processes terminate in each iteration? Give
them PIDs, and use the bit pattern of the PIDs: in the first
iteration, all odd numbered processes die, and so on.

<p>Using a "lock" as you did, in general, will reduce concurrency. We
should have as many autonomous processes as we can. And, they should
"communicate/synchronize/mutex" as little as possible.


<li>
<h2>Bag of Numbers to Set of Relative Primes</h2>

<p>
Problem: Given a finite bag B of numbers, as well as the size nb of the
bag B, produce a set S of numbers so that no two numbers in S divide
each other, and it is the largest such set that is a subbag of B.


<p>
Linda Solution:

<p>Note that the set S for a given B is not unique.  So we are entitled
to produce one or more such S as long as each of the sets is a valid
answer.  I make no claims that the solution outlined below is the
"best"; it certainly is a "good" one.  It is quite likely
that you will find several details missing.)

<p>We say that a set s is partial solution, if no two numbers in s divide
each other, and s is a subbag of B.  But s is perhaps not a largest
such bag.

<p>We add tuples of the form <"nps", i, 0> for i:1..nb giving us the
number of partial solutions of length i constructed so far.  These
counters are incremented as we build up a solution.  When finished, we
rd("nps", i, ?j) for i:nb .. 0 until we find a non-zero j.  We then 
read an/the i-long solution from the tuple space TS.

<p>Our computation proceeds in "waves": the i-th wave computes (or tries to)
all partial solutions of length i.  The last wave is for i == nb.

<p>We take (in) one element b of B, and take (in) one partial solution s
of length i-1, and see if we can extend it to a solution of length i.
If it divides or is divided by an element of s, s cannot be extended,
and no partial solution gets deposited.  Otherwise, we add b to s, and
deposit the resulting (partial) solution into the TS, and increment
the c in <"nps", i, c>.  After this is done for each element of B, we
move on to the next wave.

<p>Wave 1 starts with s == empty set.  So we should have done {out("ps",
0, empty-set) nb times; out("nps", 0, 1);}

<p>Taking one element b of B without getting blocked is not too hard.
Maintain a count of items in the current bag, <"nB", i, ni>, where is
the same i as in the waves.  Take (in) this counter, verifying that it
is > 0, in("B", i, ?b) and then deposit out("nB", i, ni-1).

<p>Generating the bag for the next wave is not too hard.  After obtaining
b, do {in("nB", i+1, ?n); out("B", i+1, b); out("nB", i+1, n+1)}.  So
we better have <"nB", i, 0> tuples for i:1..nb right after beginning.

<p>A worker process will not proceed to the next wave until after the
current i-th wave is finished; i.e., a rd("nB", i, ?n) gives n==0.
There is a next wave provide the present wave produced >0 solutions.
If i == nb, the process terminates, otherwise it increments i, and
begins on the next wave.

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>
In all of these exercises:
You lose 5 points for each use of <tt>inp</tt> or <tt>rdp</tt>.

<ol type=i>

<li>
The primes-finder will run faster if it uses &quot;striking
out&quot; instead of division—instead of dividing by k, it steps
through an array and marks as non-prime every kth
element. Re-implement the agenda-parallel program using this
approach.

<li> In the agenda-parallel primes-finder, what limit does the value
of GRAIN impose on achievable speedup?

<li> We transformed the result parallel primes-finder into an
efficient program by abstraction to agenda parallelism. One aspect of
the result version's inefficiency was its too-fine granularity; but
it's possible to build a coarser-grained result parallel version of
this code too. Implement a variable-granularity result-parallel
version.

<li> In the specialist-parallel primes-finder, the pipe segment
responsible for sieving out multiples of 3 is heavily overloaded. We
expect that large backlogs of candidates will await attention from
this process. Design a new version of the specialist-parallel program
in which pipe segments can be replicated—in particular, multiple
copies of the 3-sieve run simultaneously at the head of the
pipeline.

<li> Given a large (in the zillions) bag B of integers, find the third
  largest number in B. Assume that B has at least three distinct
  integers.  Assume that the tuple space already contains
  the <tt>bag of integers ("B", n)</tt>, the size of this bag
  (<tt>"BSZ", bsz), and ("p", p) the</tt> number of worker processes..

<li>
  In a bag <i>B</i> of <i>b</i> integers, it is known that each
  element appears exactly <i>d</i> times. We wish to delete the
  duplicates resulting in a set of only <i>b/d</i> distinct integers
  that occurred in the bag. It is guaranteed that <i>d &gt; 0, b &gt;
  0</i>. Unfortunately, the value <i>d</i> is unavailable and needs to
  be computed by examining the bag B.   Design  and
  implement a solution in C-Linda. Assume that the tuple space already
  contains <tt>&lt;&quot;B&quot;, x<sub>i</sub>&gt;</tt>for
  all <tt>x<sub>i</sub></tt> in B, and the size of the
  bag <tt>&lt;&quot;BSZ&quot;, b&gt;</tt>. You lose 5 points for each
  use of <tt>inp</tt> or <tt>rdp</tt>.

<li>You are given a large (in the zillions) bag of triplets of
  unsigned integers (x, y, d).  Each triplet represents a
  horizontal line segment of length d in the Euclidean plane whose
  left end point is at (x, y).   Two triplets (x1, y1, d1)
  and (x2, y2, d2) are said to be <i>connected</i> if  y1 == y2
  and either x1 + d1 == x2 or x2 + d2 == x1.  A triplet (x1, y1,
  d1) <i>contains</i> (x2, y2, d2) if y1 == y2 and x1 &lt;= x2 and x1
  + d1 &gt;= x2 + d2.  We would like to minimize the size (==
  number of triplets) of  the given bag of triplets so that every
  original triplet is contained in some triplet in the resulting
  collection.  (a) Design  and (b) implement a solution in
  C-Linda.  Assume that the tuple space already contains the
  triplets <tt>&lt; "t";, x, y, d&gt;</tt>, and the size of this
  bag <tt>&lt;"sz", N&gt;</tt>.
