<h2>Programming Tasks</h2>

<p>
So that you can get a comparative feel, code for a few programming tasks is 
shown in each of the languages.  The tasks are described below.

<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>If you don't know what this is, see the References ;-)</p>

<h3>Concurrently Say &quot;Enjoy&quot; &quot;Rosetta&quot; &quot;Code&quot;</h3>

<p>Using either native language concurrency syntax or freely available
libraries write a program to display the strings &quot;Enjoy&quot;
&quot;Rosetta&quot; &quot;Code&quot;, one string per line, in random
order. Concurrency syntax must use threads</a>, tasks, co-routines, or
whatever concurrency is called in your language.</p>

<h3>Compute the Digits of &pi;</h3>

<p>The program should print the digits, 10-to-a-line, of the
  mathematical constant &pi; with the running total of digits
  calculated.  See <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/">

<h3>Quick Sort</h3>
<p>Standard quick sort algorithm found in most text books.</p>
