TBD Fix links

* P3 

This Spring 2020, the CEG 7370 Project P3 is mostly about learning
Scala + Akka.  Start with the source code examples below.

* Dining Philosophers in Akka

1. TBD Fix links https://www.typesafe.com/activator/template/akka-sample-fsm-scala;; https://developer.lightbend.com/start/
1. TBD Fix links [[https://www.typesafe.com/activator/template/bundle/akka-sample-fsm-scala][akka-sample-fsm-scala.zip]]

1. These two files are "implementing" the famous Dining Philosophers
   *problem* -- not the solution.

   1. [[../Lectures/Actors+Akka+Scala/scalaExamples/DiningHakkersOnBecome.scala.html][DiningHakkersOnBecome.scala]] minor mods by Mateti; 106 lines
   1. [[../Lectures/Actors+Akka+Scala/scalaExamples/DiningHakkersOnFsm.scala.html][DiningHakkersOnFsm.scala]] minor mods by Mateti; 141 lines
   1. My versions can be compiled and run without using Activator.
      E.g.,\\
      =% scalac DiningHakkersOnBecome.scala; scala DiningHakkersOnBecome=
1. Study the source code of both Become and FSM versions.  Run the
   examples.  


* P3 in Akka

Do the following for P3.


1. (2*15 points) Observe the output of Become and FSM versions.
   Explain if any philosopher is starved.  Why or Why not?  Was it
   necessary to tweak the src code to exhibit "interesting" behavior?

1. (2*35 points) Introduce a "waiter" actor.  Now, the philosophers
   shoud not have individual starvation.  A version of this is
   described under section "Arbitrator solution" in
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

Submit four files: two Scala/Java/Kotlin source code files with
"waiter", one each for Become and FSM, and two pdf's explaining the
source code and your answers to the above.

Turnin this P3 as you did with P1 and P2.
