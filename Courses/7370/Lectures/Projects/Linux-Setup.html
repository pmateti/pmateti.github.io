<h1>Linux Setup for the WhiteBoard RPC Project</h1>


<p>It is good that several of you are using your own Linux boxes for
DIC 7370 work. But Linux installations out-of-the-box are typically
not "open" enough for our projects. (The suggested solutions on this
page <i>do</i> weaken security. This is not disastrous; Linux distros
are becoming too paranoid in the wrong places ...)

<p>On this page, I am collecting DIC 7370 related issues and
solutions.  If you find better solutions, please send them, and I will
update this page.


<h2>Sys Admin</h2>

<p>Learn to use <code>sudo</code> and <code>su</code>.  On Debian/
Ubuntu/ Knoppix/ Kali, <code>apt-get</code> is the software (un)installer.
Graphical versions: muon, synaptic, adept, kpackage.  On RedHat and
Fedora: <code>yum</code>.

<p>RPC program numbers, network port numbers, ... are system wide
resources -- not per user or per process separated entries.
Before debugging your WhiteBoard RPC project, it is good idea to
freshly reboot the host.

<h2>X11</h2>

<h3> Do Listen to TCP</h3>

<p> The X11 server runs on the machine that has the screen (and
keyboard, and mouse, ...). X11 clients can run on the same host
or some where else and network-connect to the server. The host
running the clients may or may not have the screen etc.

<p>For DIC 7370, X11 server should have been started <i>without</i>
  disabling listening to TCP connections.    A "good" one may look like
  this: <pre>/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg -listen tcp -auth
  /var/run/sddm/{a2320c42-7b0e-483a-b761-44cd4f79e4a6} -background
  none -noreset -displayfd 17 -seat seat0 vt1</pre>

<p>
List all processes, and see
  what the arguments are to Xorg.
  Exactly how it should be
started varies among distributions. Generally speaking, search for
"<code>-nolisten</code>" keyword or <code>DisallowTCP</code> among
kdm/gdm/X11 config files and delete it.  For gdm,
check <code>/etc/gdm/gdm.schemas, /etc/gdm/custom.conf,
/etc/gdm/gdm.conf</code>.  For kdm,
check <code>/etc/kde4/kdm/kdmrc</code>.
I had to replace the /usr/bin/Xorg script with my own to accomplish
this.  The script originally was this:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
#
# Execute Xorg.wrap if it exists otherwise execute Xorg directly.
# This allows distros to put the suid wrapper in a separate package.
basedir=/usr/lib/xorg
if [ -x "$basedir"/Xorg.wrap ]; then
  exec "$basedir"/Xorg.wrap "$@"
else
  exec "$basedir"/Xorg "$@"
fi
  </pre>
<p>
  The script /usr/bin/Xorg is now this:<pre>
#!/bin/sh
#
# Execute Xorg.wrap.
# This allows distros to put the suid wrapper in a separate package.

echo $@ > /tmp/da.txt
exec /usr/lib/xorg/Xorg.wrap $(sed -e 's/-nolisten/-listen/g' /tmp/da.txt)
</pre>


<h3> DISPLAY environment variable</h3>

<p> The X11 windows will show up on the screen defined by
<code>$DISPLAY</code>.  The simplest, in bash, is to do: <code>export
DISPLAY=host-name:0.0</code> BTW, you can instead use IP addresses, as
in &quot;<code>127.0.0.1:0.0</code>&quot;.<p> Example
problem: <code>client: openxwindow("localhost:0.0", ...) == -1,
failed</code> ; Diagnosis: Disable authentication control over whose
processes can open X11 windows. Solution:
<pre>xhost +</pre>

<p> For fine grain control, read <code>man xhost</code>. If you are
using, e.g. ssh -X tunnel, the DISPLAY will have a different value.
Be aware that client.c has a hard-coded display
number: <code>strcat(cd->xdisplaynm, ":0.0");</code>

<h3>Development Libraries</h3>

<p>Install the X11 development libraries.  Do the equivalent
of <code>apt-get install libx11-dev</code> </p>

<h2>Networking</h2>

<p>
The host name lookups should be correct. This is a combination of
<code>/etc/hosts</code> and how you set up DNS. E.g., if ":0.0" works
but "localhost:0.0" does not, the problem is with your /etc/hosts
file.  Entries in <code>/etc/hosts.deny</code> cause connections to be
refused. Understand what is in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>

<p>You will benefit from installing <code>sshd, smbd, nmap,
traceroute</code>

<p>Learn to log into a remote server <i>without password</i> but with
automated authentication and encryption:

http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/ Courses/2350/ Labs/Network/
NetworkLab.html#ssh</a>

<h2>RPC</h2>

<ol>
<li><code>rpcgen</code> program exists on practically all OS.  But,
its generated C/C++ code can look very different from what is generated in
  Linux.

<li>We use <code>rpcinfo</code> as a diagnostic command. On Ubuntu, it
is located in <code>/usr/sbin/</code>. Before you start any of
WhiteBoard processes, do <code> <code>rpcinfo -p</code></code> and make a
note of what is listed.  After starting WhiteBoard processes,
check what <code>rpcinfo -p</code> shows.

<li>Example problem: <code>"Cannot register service: RPC: Unable to
receive; errno = Connection refused unable to register
(WhiteBoardServer, WhiteBoardServerVersion, ...)."</code>  Diagnosis:
RPC portmapper is missing.  Solution:
Install <code>nfs-kernel-server</code>.  This will install NFS, but as
a side-effect installs RPC support.

<li>Example problem: <code>&quot;Cannot register service: RPC:
Authentication error; why = Client credential too weak unable to
register (registryProg, registryVers, ...)&quot;</code> Diagnosis: We
need rpcbind to be running in the insecure mode. Solution: List all
processes, and see what the arguments are to rpcbind.  If it is
just <code>rpcbind -w</code>, kill that process and restart it
as <code> rpcbind -w -i</code>. This solves it for just this session.
Permanent solution: Find the config file(s) for rpcbind, and fix the
options;  on Ubuntu, <code>/etc/init/portmap*.conf,
/etc/init/rpc*.conf</code>.
<code> rpcbind </code> is the portmapper; a few years ago, its name
was rpc.portmap.
