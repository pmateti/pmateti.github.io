<p>This is a general outline. Depending on how your program is behaving I may
ask you to do different actions. When you are ready, make a short (10 minutes?)
appointment for the demo; immediately after our class preferred. All are
invited to watch the demos. Bring a copy of this to your demo.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Instantiate one server s1, two whiteboards b1 and b2, and four clients. 
    <ol>
      <li>Use as many hosts as possible. For C+RPC, use at least two
        different CPU types, if possible.
      </li>
      <li>Click a few lines in each drawlines-window to show that the
        "original" functionality is still present. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Start a new server s2 on a new host. Add a whiteboard b3 with one client
    to s2. Do 1.2 again. </li>
  <li>Add a new client to each of the existing whiteboards. Do 1.2 again. </li>
  <li>Transfer b2 (and all clients on it) to s2. Do 1.2 again. Show what is
    where.</li>
  <li>Add a new whiteboard b4 with just one client to server s1. Do 1.2 again.
  </li>
  <li>Transfer b3 to s1. Transfer b4 to s2. Do 1.2 again. Show what is
  where.</li>
  <li>Terminate each client by right-clicking. Show the results via
    <code>ps</code> (For P1: rpcinfo -p also).</li>
</ol>
