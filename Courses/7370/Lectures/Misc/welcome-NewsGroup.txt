Welcome to the discussion group on CEG 7370

This is a local (WSU only) discussion group for anyone interested in CEG
7370.  It will contain questions, and answers related to topics
discussed in 7370.  It is quite likely that this group will contain
mostly questions, and hardly any answers.

If nothing else, you will then know the pool of exam questions ;-)

As you all (will) know, I do not believe in simply providing answers.
More important than knowing the answers is the learning that happens
when *you* *seriously* try to discover answers to puzzling questions.

But the answers that I do give outside the classroom to those of you
who visit me are given only on the condition that you will write the
question and answer nicely, and post to this newsgroup.  

Any e-mail questions I receive are first posted here, and if no one
else answers them in a couple of days, I will.

This medium ("electronic bulletin board") is similar to "interactive
conversations."  So, there is no need to take great care as we do in
(formal) writing; but, if you do write well and carefully, your
readers will appreciate that.  

My intent is to promote discussion, (dissenting, if need be) argument,
and critical analysis.  Not judging.

If (you think) you know the answer to a question posed here, answer
it!
