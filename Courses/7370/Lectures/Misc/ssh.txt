The following commands generate an ssh key pair and add it to your              
authorized keys.                                                                
                                                                                
> ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024                                                     
Generating public/private dsa key pair.                                         
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/corey/.ssh/id_dsa):                 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):                                     
Enter same passphrase again:                                                    
Your identification has been saved in id_dsa2.                                  
Your public key has been saved in id_dsa2.pub.    
The key fingerprint is:                                                         
b6:fc:ca:ef:83:9c:01:1a:6f:fb:31:df:ab:db:89:1d corey@BadApple                  
> cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys                               
> chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys                                              
                                                                                
Now you should be able to log in to any machine in the OSIS lab using ssh       
without a password.                                                             
                                                                                
> ssh perlis                                                                    
                                                                                
Better yet this command will forward your X11 connection as well.  This         
allows you to run remote X applications and display them to your local          
machine. The DISPLAY environment variable is automatically set. No need to      
do xhost + or any wierd xauth things.                                           
                                                                                
> ssh -X perlis                                                                 
> xcalc                                                                         
                                                                                
To run a command on a remote host with ssh the command looks like this:         
                                                                                
> ssh perlis hostname                                                           
perlis                                                                          
                                                                                
This runs the hostname command on perlis.                                       
                                                                                
If you are interested in setting up ssh on gamma, gandalf, and thor let me      
know.  Those systems use a different ssh implementation and the setup is        
slightly different.
