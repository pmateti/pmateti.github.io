We have a \CSP\ process {\tt C} that outputs an unending stream of
non-negative numbers to a process named, say, {\tt X}.  We want {\tt
X} to be able to receive requests of the form {\tt X!nthmin(n)} from a
user process {\tt U} and respond with {\tt U!x}, where $x$ is the
$n$-th smallest number it has seen so far from {\tt C}.  If {\tt X}
has seen fewer than $n$ numbers so far, or if $n$ is greater than 10,
or less than 1, the value of $x$ to use is -1.  Write the process {\tt
X} in \CSP.  Maximize concurrency.  Process {\tt C} must not suffer
delays.
