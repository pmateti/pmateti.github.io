  annote = { No secure network file system has ever grown to span the
                  Internet. Existing systems all lack adequate key
                  management for security at a global scale. Given the
                  diversity of the Internet, any particular mechanism
                  a file system employs to manage keys will fail to
                  support many types of use. We propose separating key
                  management from file system security, letting the
                  world share a single global file system no matter
                  how individuals manage keys. We present SFS, a
                  secure file system that avoids internal key
                  management. While other file systems ...  },
