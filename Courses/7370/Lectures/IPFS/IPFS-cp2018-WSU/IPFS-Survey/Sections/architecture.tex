\section{Architecture of IPFS}\label{seArchitecture}

{
Identities - manage node identity generation and verification.
Network - manages connections to other peers, uses various underlying network protocols. Configurable.
Routing - maintains information to locate specific peers and objects. Responds to both local and remote queries. Defaults to a DHT, but is swappable.
Exchange - a novel block exchange protocol (BitSwap) that governs efficient block distribution. Modelled as a market, weakly incentivizes data replication. Trade Strategies swappable.
Objects - a Merkle DAG of content-addressed immutable objects with links. Used to represent arbitrary data structures, e.g. file hierarchies and communication systems.
Files - versioned file system hierarchy inspired by Git.
Naming - A self-certifying mutable name system.
}

IPFS - Content Addressed, Versioned, P2P File System
