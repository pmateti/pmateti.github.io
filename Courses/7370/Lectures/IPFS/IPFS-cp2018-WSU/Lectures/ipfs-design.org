* Goal of this Lecture

1. Explain the 2014 Draft#3 IPFS paper by Juan Benet.
1. I will make it obvious: My opinions and assessments.

* What does "IPFS" Offer?

1. IPFS offers the following "combined" when finished (?).
1. Linux/ ... OS File System.
1. Web content, as it is now (2018).
1. Network accessible.


** Object Storage

1. Digital Objects are stored across the globe: distributed,
   decentralized.

** Permanency

1. A permanent storage system for (files and other) digital objects.

** Ownership

1. No single entity owns the system, or any part of it.


** Permissions

** Content Addressed

1. Content addressed, not location addressed.
1. Location Based Addressing
1. Content Based Addressing

** Immutable

1. Version controlled, immutable.
1. Digital ledgers,

** Network Accessible Uniformly

** Distributed Web Applications (DApps)

** FAQs

1. Will something added to IPFS remain available to others if I turn
   off my computer? https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/8  TBD

1. Can I delete (my) content from the network? No.
   https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/9

1. Does IPFS guarantee anonymity?
   https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/12 Not yet, TBD it's a simple
   DHT router but TOR-like routing is planned.

1. Is ipfs fit for personal blog pages? https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/30
1. https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/45


* What is "IPFS"?

1. IPFS, an acronym for "InterPlanetary File System".
1. A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol: =ipfs://=.  TBD
1. A networked storage system that can be =mount= -ed.

** Terminology

1. Distributed
1. Decentralized
1. Associative Arrays
1. Key-Value Stores
1. Crypto Hash



* Technologies Used

1. Kademlia
1. BitTorrent
1. Git
1. Self-certifying File System

* Subsystems

1. https://github.com/ipfs/examples/tree/master/examples/ipns The
   IPNS InterPlanetary Naming System

1. IPLD

* Merkle Trees/ Forest


* Selected Applications

1. Orbit chat https://orbit.chat/
1. Image "hosting": http://ipfs.pics/

* Storage

1.  no guarantees of redundancy, need people to request your data.[faq#5](https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/5)
  1. [filecoin](http://filecoin.io/) as an incentize to replicate data
1. [Is it possible to limit the size of a local storage?](https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/34)
1. [Can I control the amount of storage/bandwidth dedicated to IPFS?](https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/11)

* Security

1. https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/learn-to-securely-share-files-on-the-blockchain-with-ipfs-219ee47df54c
   Learn to securely share files on the blockchain with IPFS!

* Privacy & Anonymity


1. Having a private swarm is not implemented yet (cf. [faq#4](https://github.com/ipfs/faq/issues/4))
  1. possible alternative: could encrypt files and store them on public IPFS
