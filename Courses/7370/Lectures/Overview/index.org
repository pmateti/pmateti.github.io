** Home Work 0%

1. Homework will be given.  But neither collected nor graded.  Implies
   that you will work on various things on your own and discuss.

1. Homework for this week, as a sample:
1. Learn the Mine Sweeper game.  Imagine each cell is a computer
   system.  A cell talks to neighbors only through message passing.
   How do we program it?

* Survey of Prerequisites


1. We will try to fill you in on most of the prerequisites. The survey
   is for that purpose. In some ways it may be better that you have
   not heard of some of these things.

1. Post on Piazza as well as interact now to this [[../Overview/survey.org][Survey of
   Prerequisites]].

** Survey: Concepts from Concurrency

1. How familiar are you with: critical sections, mutual exclusion,
   message passing, synchronization, fairness, starvation,
   non-determinism?

1. Can you differentiate deadlocks from livelocks? safety from liveness?


** Survey: Constructs from Concurrent Programming

1. How familiar are you with: Critical Regions, Monitors, binary and
   general Semaphores?

1. How familiar are you with IPC mechanisms of Linux?

** Survey: Classic Problems

1. How familiar are you with: Producers and Consumers, Readers and
   Writers, Dining Philosphers, Roll-Your-Own Cigarette Smoking,
   Sleeping Barber, Drinking Philosophers.

** Survey: Formal Semantics

1. How familiar are you with: assertions, pre- post-conditions, loop
   and class invariants.

1. How familiar are you with: Happened Before?
1. How familiar are you with: Propositions, Predicates and Temporal
   Logic?


** Survey: Program Development

1. How long is the longest C/C++ program that you have written
   individually?

1. Same question but with Java.

1. Same question but with Scala.  (Very possible that you have done
   nothing with this language.)

1. How familiar are you with =make, ant, maven, gradle=, and various
   build-tools?

1. What IDEs have you used and for how long?  E.g., idea/ eclipse/ 
   netbeans/ other-IDEs.  On Linux? On Windows?

* Course Lecture Samples

​1. We are picky about our terms.  Ex: "Process"
1. All the following are conceptually the same: process, thread, task, job, ...
2. On a given platform (e.g., Linux): process v thread v ... are different
1. By def: a single process is sequential

1. Muliprocess v Multiprocessor v Multi-core: Same? Similar?

** Concurrency Fundamentals #1: Non-Determinacy

1. Ex: Consider the simple assignment statement
   1. {x := 3 [] 7} (Note the fat-bar)
   1. What is the value of x?
   2. Either 3 or 7; nothing else; but which??
   4. Code better be prepared for either.
2. The above computation P is non-determinant. Each time we run, the
   result of P may change "for no good reason."  Why? Because
   "non-determinacy" [] is baked in.

** Concurrency Fundamentals #2: Meta Terminology

1. Fundamentals v Principles v Foundations
1. Concurrency Fundamentals constitute the core of this course.
1. Until the last week of this course, we will use /concurrency/ as a
   term covering all of /networked/-, /parallel/-, and /distributed/-
   computing.

** Semaphores Defs

1. A /semaphore/ s is an OOP ADT (abstract data type) variable. It has
   an integer private data member s, only operable with two public
   methods called P and V, apart from being initialized.
1. P(s) ≡ ‹ await  s > 0 → s := s-1 ›
1. V(s) ≡ ‹ s := s+1 ›
1. The complications in the defs are (i) the atomic angular-brackets
   and (ii) the meaning of /await/.


** Starvation-Free Mutual Exclusion

1. {semaphore m := 1; P(m); Process-i; V(m)}
2. This is starvation-/prone/ in a  distributed context.
1. Designing starvation-free solutions is part of this course.

** Starvation-Free MutEx: One Solution Idea

#+ATTR_HTML: :border 0
[[./Figures/starv-free.jpg]]
1. The dots are processes.  The thick-rectangles are gates letting in
   one process at a time. The black rectangle is where we require starve-free
   mutex.  A process finishing this will exit as the black dot did,
   skipping over the black-, red- and green boundaries.
1. What is the rest of the "idea"?

** Axiomatics #1

1. Axiomatics is a way of defining the meaning of PL constructs, in a
   way much better than English prose.
1. Notationally, we use the triplet < P, S, Q > where P and Q are
   assertions (True/False Boolexp) on process state, S is a piece of code.
1. Q describes the state after S completed.  It assumes that P was
   true when code S started.
1. P is called a /pre-condition/.  Q is called a /post-condition./

** Axiomatics #2

1. Here is an example applied to semaphore def.

1. P(s) can be defined as follows: Given [(R and s > 0) ⇒
   Q(s, s-1)], we can conclude <R, P(s), Q>
2. V(s) can be defined as follows: Given [R ⇒ Q(s, s+1),
      we can conclude <R, V(s), Q>
3. There will be considerable discussion on this.

** Project on RPC #1

1. RPC Architecture [We will go over this in considerable detail.]
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 60%
[[./Figures/rpc-diag-tikz.jpg]]


** Project on RPC #2 Marshalling/ Serializing

1. How do we send data structures that contain links/addresses to
   machines across the network?

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 35%
[[./Figures/rpc-marshalling-tikz.jpg]]

** Actors

1. An /actor/ is an extremely light weight process communicating with
   other actors through mailboxes.  No shared variables.

A problem created to illustrate concurrency issues. In our course, we
wish to do this in Scala with Akka actors.

1. Requirements: Transparency, Concurrency, Replication,
   Heterogeneity, Fault tolerance, Consistency, Security, Efficiency.

   failures.  cf. CAP "theorem".
