I will try to fill you in on most of the prerequisites.  The survey
below is for that purpose.  In some ways it may be better that you
have not heard of some of these things.  Post on Piazza this survey
answered in (some) detail.

* Concepts from Concurrency

1. How familiar are you with: critical sections, mutual exclusion,
   message passing, synchronization, fairness, starvation,
   non-determinism?

1. Can you differentiate deadlocks from livelocks? safety from liveness?


* Constructs from Concurrent Programming

1. How familiar are you with: Critical Regions, monitors, binary and
   general semaphores?

1. How familiar are you with IPC mechanisms of Linux?

* Classic Problems

1. How familiar are you with: Producers and Consumers, Readers and
   Writers, Dining Philosphers, Roll-Your-Own Cigarette Smoking,
   Sleeping Barber, Drinking Philosophers.

* Formal Semantics

1. How familiar are you with: assertions, pre- post-conditions, loop
   and class invariants.

* Program Development

1. What is your program development experience using Linux, and using
   Windows?

1. What is the largest C/C++ program that you have written personally?
   Give the (approximated) number in pages. (A typical code page has
   about 50 lines, a line may be typically 20 characters.)

1. Same question but with Java.

1. Same question but with Scala.  (Very possible that you have done
   nothing with this language.)

1. How familiar are you with =make, ant, maven=, and various
   cli-tools?

1. What IDEs have you used and for how long?  E.g., idea/ eclipse/
