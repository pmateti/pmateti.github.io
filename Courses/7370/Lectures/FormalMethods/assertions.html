<h1>Assertions</h1>

<h3 style="color: brown">Prabhaker Mateti</h3>

<p>This page is about assertions, without concurrency related issues.

</section><section><h3>Propositions</h3>

<ol>
<li>
True and False are propositions.  

<li>
For other
propositions, we often use letters.  These are assigned a True or
False value in an interpretation.  <li>
A formula involves these things and
the and (^) or (v) not (~) symbols also.  <li>
A well-formed-formula (wff)
is defined synatctically.
</ol>

</section><section><h3>Predicates</h3>

<ol>
<li> Ex: x > 1 is a predicate.  <li>It has one free variable, x.  
<li> In the programming context, think of free variables as globally
scoped variables.

<li>Predicates can involve for-all and there-exists quantifiers.
</ol>

</section><section><h3>P ==> Q ie P is Stronger than Q</h3>

<ol>

<li>Meaning of P implies Q: Consider a particular assignment A of
values for each of the free variables x, y, z of P and Q that make P
come out True.  A should also make Q True.  If this happens for all A
then we say P implies Q.
<ul>
  <li>Simple example: x > 7 implies x > 1.

  <li>We say that P is stronger than Q.  Alt: Q
    is weaker than P.

  <li>In the context of programming, we can refer to this A as a "state".
</ul>

<li>Let C(Q) be the collection of such assignment of values that make Q
come out as True.
<ul>
<li>C(P) is a subset of C(Q)

<li>If C(P) = C(Q), P is equivalent to Q.
</ul>

</section><section><h2>Floyd-Hoare Triples</h2>

{P} S {Q}<br>

<p>
is defined as<br><br>

<p style="text-align: center">For all states s that satisfy P, executing S on s, the resulting
state s' is such that s' satisfies Q, if and when S terminates.

<br><br>
<p>Note that the above is about partial correctness: It omits
termination.

Practical Advice on Writing Assertions</a> by Prabhaker Mateti

<p>
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html">
Programming With Assertions in Java</a> "Experience has shown that
writing assertions while programming is one of the quickest and most
effective ways to detect and correct bugs. As an added benefit,
assertions serve to document the inner workings of your program,
enhancing maintainability.  This document shows you how to program
with assertions."

C++."  Open source.

</section><section><h3>Programming with Assertions-2</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.splint.org/"> splint.org</a> Splint is a tool for
compile-time checking C of programs beyond what typical compilers do
on the same source code.  If additional assertions are added, Splint
can perform even stronger checking.  Open source.

<a href="http://frama-c.com/"> frama-c.com</a> Frama-C is a suite of
tools using assertions to mathematically analyse C code.  Open source.


</section><section><h2>Exercises</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Study the Mine Sweepers game.  Write down in English prose the
      numerical relations ships of the displayed numbers of bombs in
      neighbors, etc.  Now, redo using PL boolean expressions.

    <li>Develop assertions for classic sorting algorithms, e.g.,
      bubble sort.

    <li>
      See the Exercises in Andrews.

  <li> Does the precondition and statement {x&nbsp; &ge; 4 } &lt; x := x - 4 
    &gt; interfere with the triple<br>
    {x is odd} &lt; x := x + 5 &gt; {x is even}.</li>
  <li> Using the technique of weakened assertions, prove that {x = 1}
    S {x = 7} is a theorem, where S is <tt> &nbsp;co &lt; x := x+1&gt;
    || &lt; x := x+2&gt; || &lt; x := x+3&gt; oc</tt></li>
