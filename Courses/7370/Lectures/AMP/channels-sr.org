* Channels of SR

1. In the book, Andrews uses a language, without ever giving us its
   name SR, designed by him and implemented by his group.

2. A *channel* is an SR PL construct for AMP
   1. =channel semop[1 .. n](sender: int, k: kind, timestamp: int)=
   2. An array of channels, indexed 1 to n
   3. Each element is a triplet of (sender, k, timestamp)

3. =send semop[j](i, VEE, lc)=
   1. selects one channel =semop[j]= and deposits the triplet =(i, VEE, lc)=
   1. i, VEE, lc are expressions of types int, kind, int
4. =receive semop[j](i, v, lc)=
   1. selects one channel =semop[j]= and retrieves a triplet
   2. i, v, lc are local variables of the receiving process of types
      int, kind, int respectively
   1. i, v, lc are assigned the triplet's values
5. =broadcast semop(i, VEE, lc)=
   1. does =send semop[j](i, VEE, lc) for all j: 1 .. n=
   2. in parallel

   {pmateti: SR provided remote/local procedure calls (RPC-like),
   rendezvous (as in Ada), sending a msg to a procedure (that created
   a transient process), and send! coupled with in? that resulted in
   message passing.}  Recommended Visits.
