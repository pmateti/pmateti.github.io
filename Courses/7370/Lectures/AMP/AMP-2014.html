<h1>Asynchronous Message Passing AMP</h1>

instead of ppt slides.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous Message Passing AMP</h2>

<ol>
<li> send message e to process B<br>
  -- e an expression
<li> receive message x from process A<br>
  -- var x local to B
<li> receiver waits if there are no messages
<li> send operation never blocks<br>
-- implies infinite buffering<br>
-- no implied synchronization<br>
-- can send messages to self<br>
-- communication only

<li> Order of receive = Order of send
<li> sender and receiver execute independently<br>
<li> "time gap" between send and the corresponding receive can be large
</ol>

<h2>Channels</h2>

<ol>
<li>A PL construct for AMP<br>
ex: <tt>channel semop[1 .. n](sender: int, k: kind, timestamp: int)</tt>
<li>send semop[j](i, VEE, lc)<br>
-- selects one channel (semop[j]) and deposits the triplet (i, VEE, lc)<br>
-- i, VEE, lc are expressions of types int, kind, int
<li>receive semop[j](i, v, lc)<br>
-- selects one channel (semop[j]) and retrieves a triplet<br>
-- i, v, lc are local variables of the receiving process of types int, kind, int<br>
-- i, v, lc are assigned the triplet's values
<li>broadcast semop(i, VEE, lc)<br>
-- does <tt>send semop[j](i, VEE, lc)</tt>  for all j: 1 .. n<br>
-- in parallel
</ol>

<h2>Event Ordering</h2>

<ol>
<li>An event is the execution of anything: a statement, a send, a
  receive, etc.
<li>Any two events a and b in a single process (i.e., without //, only
  has ; and []) are clearly ordered: 
  <p>either a happens before b (written a &rarr; b) or the otherway (b
    &rarr; a).
<li>Let a and b be two events taken from two processes.
  Can we order these two?

  If a is the sending of a message, and b is the receiving
  of <i>that</i> message, we can see that  <p>a &rarr; b.

<li>What if a and b are not so?  We cannot say either that a &rarr; b
  or the otherway b &rarr; a.
<li>Happens Before is transitive: 
  <p>a &rarr; b and b &rarr; c implies a &rarr; c.
<li>Events across processes are only partially ordered.
</ol>


<h2>Logical Clocks</h2>

<ol>
<li>Distributed systems do not have central clocks.  
<li>Yet, we desire to establish a total order among events across
  processes.  That is, we wish either a &rarr; b or b &rarr; a even
  when a and b are not from the same process or send/receives.
<li>A <i>logical clock </i> is a private counter maintained by each
  process.
<li>On every event, <tt>lc := lc + 1</tt>.
<li>Include lc as part of every message sent, as the time stamp of the sender.
<li>On receiving(m, ts), receiver does <tt>lc := max(lc, ts+1) + 1</tt>
<li>Assume lc never overflows.
</ol>



<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<li>Discuss:  <i>Asynchronous</i>&nbsp; message passing is more
  fundamental than <i>synchronous</i> message passing.  That is, given
  SMP send/recv can we construct AMP send/recv? </li>
<li> Discuss: <i>Peer-to-peer distributed computing</i> is just an academic
  term for the commercial term <i>client-server computing</i>.</li>
</ol>
