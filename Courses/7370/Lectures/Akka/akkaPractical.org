* Akka Install

1. Versions: Scala 2.11+, Akka 2.3.1+.  Code for older versions may
   not work with these versions.  Most, not 100%, are open source.

1. https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-scala/ Must
   read and follow.  This will show howto install Akka and gives a
   "hello-world" of Akka.

* How Does Akka work?

1. Akka can be used without defining a configuration, since sensible
   default values are provided.

    #+begin_src scala
// application.conf at the root of the class path.
akka {
  loggers = ["akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLogger"]
  loglevel = "DEBUG"
  stdout-loglevel = "WARNING"
  actor {
    provider = "akka.cluster.ClusterActorRefProvider"
    default-dispatcher {
      # set to 1 for as fair as possible
      throughput = 10
    }
  }
  remote { netty.tcp.port = 2552  }
}
#+end_src

* Akka Hello World

1. Study
   https://alvinalexander.com/scala/simple-scala-akka-actor-examples-hello-world-actors/
1. Make sure you actually run it.

* Akka and Other PL


1. The code shown in various blogs is not always self-contained enough
   to compile it stand-alone.  Even the syntax may need tweaking.

1. =scala.actor= is deprecated.  Caution: Many articles on the web
   are based on scala.actor.  Use =import akka.actor= .
   http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/actors-migration-guide.html

1. Akka library can be used in Java as well.
1. http://www.pykka.org/ with Python.
