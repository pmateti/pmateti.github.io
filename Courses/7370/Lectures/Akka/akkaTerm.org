* Overview of Lectures

1. What do these lecture notes do?
1. Describe Scala minimally.  Just enough to do Akka.  Pretty much
   ignore its (i) functional programming features, (ii) syntactic
   conveniences and (iii) type inference [not wholly].  Goto What is
   Scala?

1. Describe Carl Hewitt's Actors Model, comparable in depth to our
   treatment of SMP, AMP, Shared-Vars, Semaphores.  Goto Actors Model.

1. Describe Akka, an implementation of Actors.  Just enough so you can
   re-do all the classics such as Readers/Writers, Dining
   Philosophers.  Goto What is Akka?

* What is Scala?

1. Scala can be thought of as a significantly enhanced Java.

1. Combines OOP and Functional Programming.

1. Uses Type Inference heavily.

1. Compiles to JVM .class files.

1. Scala is described fully at http://www.scala-lang.org/.  Its
   compilers and other tools are open source.

1. [[../Languages/Scala/scalaPractical.html][Scala Practical]] My lecture notes.  Required Reading.


* Actors Model

1. A model of distributed computation.

1. Uses AMP only.  

1. No semaphores. No SMP.  

1. Can we build these in Actors?

1. [[./actors.html][On Actors]] My lecture notes.  Required Reading.


* What is Akka?

1. Akka is an open source implementation of Hewitt's (pure) [[./actors.html][Actor
   Model]], as a library in Scala.  It makes practical concessions to
   the pure actor model.

1. "Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent,
   distributed, and fault tolerant event-driven applications on the
   JVM" http://www.akka.io.  [Note the use of concurrent *and*
   distributed.]

1. Akka helps with scaling both UP (utilizing multi-core processors) and
   OUT (utilizing the cloud/ grid/ cluster).

1. For fault-tolerance, Akka adopts the "Let it crash" model, which has
   been used with great success in the telecom industry to build
   applications that self-heal and never stop.

1. Reactive Applications = Concurrency + Events

** What is Akka? v.nonFrivolous

1. Includes an implementation of Actor Model, with improvements for practicality.

1. Also includes Software Transactional Memory (STM).

1. Event driven, middleware framework

1. Part of Typesafe Stack. Open source, Apache License.  

1. Created by Jonas Bonér.

** Large Scale Examples of Akka

1. http://www.playframework.com/ "The High Velocity Web Framework For
   Java and Scala" Built on Akka, Play provides predictable and
   minimal resource consumption (CPU, memory, threads) for
   highly-scalable applications.  RESTful by default.

   1. REST stands for "Representational State Transfer".  It describes
      a web architecture.

1. Play https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play

1. http://spray.io/ =spray= is an open-source toolkit for building
   REST/HTTP-based integration layers on top of Scala and Akka.  It is
   asynchronous, and actor-based.


** Akka Practical Use Overview

1. Versions: Scala 2.11+, Akka 2.3.1+.  Code for older versions may
   not work with these versions.  Most, not 100%, are open source.

1. https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-scala/ Must
   read and follow.

1. The code shown in boxes below is not always self-contained enough to
   compile it stand-alone.

1. =scala.actor= is deprecated.  Caution: Many articles on the web
   are based on scala.actor.  Use =import akka.actor= .
   http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/actors-migration-guide.html

1. Akka library can be used in Java as well.
1. http://www.pykka.org/ with Python.

** How Does Akka work?

#+CAPTION: How Does Akka work?
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt fig-actor-users.png :align center :width 100%
[[./Figures/fig-akka-how-works.png]]

** Akka Practical Details

1. Akka can be used without defining a
   configuration, since sensible default values are provided.

    #+begin_src scala
// application.conf at the root of the class path.
akka {
  loggers = ["akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLogger"]
  loglevel = "DEBUG"
  stdout-loglevel = "WARNING"
  actor {
    provider = "akka.cluster.ClusterActorRefProvider"
    default-dispatcher {
      # set to 1 for as fair as possible
      throughput = 10
    }
  }
  remote { netty.tcp.port = 2552  }
}
#+end_src



* Akka Actor Architecture

#+CAPTION: Actor Hierarchy and Name Resolution
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt fig-actor-hierarchy.png  :title Actor Hierarchy and Name Resolution :align center :width 100%
[[./Figures/fig-actor-hierarchy.png]]

1. An actor in Akka always belongs to a parent.  Who is the parent of
   the first actor you create? "Root Guardian", similar to parent of /
   in Linux.

1. Read further https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/guide/tutorial_1.html#the-akka-actor-hierarchy


* Akka Ops: Create, Send, Become, Supervise

1. Akka has =Create, Send, Become, Supervise= operations on its actors.
   These are essential to use Akka.

1. [[./akkaOps.org]] My Lectures Notes on Akka Operations.

* Routers, Dispatchers, and Schedulers

1. A router is a type of actor.  Routes incoming messages to
   outbound actors.
1. A dispatcher chooses an actor and a message from the actors mbox,
   and allocates a thread.
1. You can schedule sending of messages and execution of tasks
   (functions or Runnable).

1. [[./akkaRDS.org]] My Lecture Notes on Routers, Dispatchers, and
   Schedulers


* Futures and Promises

1. [[./akkaFutures.org]] My lecture notes on Akka futures and promises.
   Below is a crude and quick summary.

1. Akka gets Futures and Promises from Scala.

1. Example of a Future: Below, =s.getFriends= is a normal method.  Had we not
   enclosed it inside the future braces, control would not return
   until this method completes.  The value =f= is a future object that
   encapsulates the computation that is inside the =getFriends=
   method.  The computation is not yet scheduled, but will be.

   #+begin_src scala
import scala.concurrent.{ future, promise }
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
val s = socialNetwork.createSessionFor("user", credentials)
val f: Future[List[Friend]] = future {
  s.getFriends()           // may take a while
}
#+end_src

1. Invoking the future-braces starts an asynchronous computation and
   "immediately" returns a "future object".  The results of this =f=
   become available once the async computation *completes*.

** Promises

1. Example of a Promise:  We re-do the well-known producer-consumer.
   #+begin_src scala
import scala.concurrent.{ future, promise }
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
val p = promise[T]                 // T is unimportant for now
val f = p . future                 // extra spaces for clarity
val prdcr = future {               // producer
  val r = produceSomething()
  p . success . r
  continueDoingSomethingUnrelated()
}
val cnsmr = future {              // consumer
  startDoingSomething()
  f . onSuccess {
    case r => doSomethingWithResult()
  }}
   #+end_src


1. A Promise p is a value that completes a future f. Methods: =success=,
   =failure=, =complete=


* Distributed Actor System

1. A Distributed Actor System is a collection of Akka actors running
   on multiple machines that are networked.
1. [[./akkaDistributed.org]] My lecture notes.

* Termination

1. What Does "Finished" Mean? The most natural answer to this question
   appears to be, "When all the Mailboxes are empty." Natural, yes;
   correct, no. :)

      abstract class Reaper extends Actor {
        import Reaper._
        val watched = ArrayBuffer.empty[ActorRef]
       
        /* Derivations must implement this method. Called 
         * when everything is dead */
      
        def allSoulsReaped(): Unit
       
        final def receive = {
          case WatchMe(ref) =>
            context.watch(ref)
            watched += ref
          case Terminated(ref) =>
            watched -= ref
            if (watched.isEmpty) allSoulsReaped()
        }
      }
