<h1>Programs and Processes</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>The word &quot;program&quot; is often used loosely, and
interchangeably with the word &quot;process&quot;.  But we should be
very careful in the use of this word.  It is silly to say that &quot;a
program is running.&quot; It should be &quot;a process is
running.&quot; This article and the associated lab experiment serve as
a technical introduction at the freshman level to programs and
processes.  It introduces the control of processes as in stopping,
resuming, changing priorities, and explains the resources (such as CPU
time, etc.) consumed.
</ol>
</p></blockquote>

<h1><a name="Programs">Programs</a></h1>

<p>A <i>program</i> is a static (i.e., unchanging/passive)
entity.  It is a file whose content is rigidly formulated as
needed by the operating system.  For each OS, there are several
such rigid formats.  In Linux, ELF is the most common, and there
are other formats.  In Windows, the EXE format is the most
common, and the obsolete COM format is till in use.</p>


<p>Programs are divided into two classes for the purposes of this
course: Applications and Systems Programs.  Programs such as word
processors, email clients, web browsers are applications.  Programs
such as init (that controls the sessions of an OS), the loader that
load a program into memory as a required prelude to making the program
into a process, ifconfig/ ipconfig (that set the parameters of network
cards) are systems programs.  Programs whose absence would make an OS
incomplete/ crippled are called <i>systems</i> programs.  Programs
that make a computer system useful in a particular way are
applications.  This definition has been evolving over the decades.
E.g., compilers, linkers, and shells used be considered systems
programs.
</p>

<h2>Creation of Programs</h2>

<p><i>We</i> write the <i>source code</i> of programs.  A program may
also have help files, documentation, and other such files. These are
not essential in that their absence will not disable the launching of
a program.  When these files are asked for, you will only get a
&quot;missing file&quot; error.</p>

<h3>Compiling</h3>

<p>
The source code is a file of text that must abide by the syntax and
semantics of some programming language.  Some well known programming
languages are C++, Java, Perl, Python, and Assembly.  For reasons of
modularity and manageability, the source code is often split into
multiple files.</p>


<p>
Source code files are processed by programs called compilers,
interpreters, and assemblers.  After compilation of the source
code, <i>object code</i> files are produced.  The content of the
object files is rigidly controlled.  It is often the case that source
code files written in different programming langauges are compiled
into object code files that can be linked together.

<p>In Linux, object code files have .o extension; in Windows, the
extension for object code files is <tt>.obj</tt>.

<p>Java files typically get compiled into the byte code of JVM, which is
platform (i.e., CPU and OS) independent; the extension for these byte
code files is <tt>.class</tt>.  There are regular compilers also
that compile Java straight into the machine code of a specific
CPU.</p>

Integrated development environments (IDE) are the primary tools for
developing programs.  Behind the scences, they compile, link, and
manage the entire development activity.  In this course, we are trying
to understand these activities.  In Linux, the command line tools with
the names gcc or g++ are <i>driver</i> programs that examine the
arguments in a sophisticated way given and invoke appropriate tools
(such as compilers, assemblers, and linkers) based on the arguments.


<h3>Linking</h3>

<p>The object code files and methods/ procedures/ functions from
pre-existing library files are <i>linked</i> into an <i>executable
file</i> that is then qualified to be called a
<i>program</i>.  In Linux, programs (traditionally) do not have any
extension.  In Windows, program files have <tt>.exe</tt>
extension.  Files with<tt> .com</tt> extension are 
old format program files dating from MS DOS.  

<p>
The structure and content of an object code file obeys rigid rules.
Conceptually, we can think of each file beginning with a TOC (table of
contents like in a book), followed by the executable machine code of
the various methods.  The TOC describes among aother things imported
and exported symbols (i.e., names of variables, methods, etc).  A
given object file may use names that are defined elsewhere; these are
imported sysmbols.  A given object code file may define some symbols
that may or may not be used within that file, but are intended to be
of use elsewhere.  These are exported symbols.

<p>A linker (also called linkage editor) essentially "stitches" the
object code files together replacing all references of imported
symbols with their addresses defined in the exports list.  This
stitching succeeds only when all the imported symbols across all
object code files, that make up one program, are found among the
exported symbols (including those exported by various libraries).

<p>In Linux, the linker is actually named ld for historical reasons.
It has nothing to do with the loading activity described below.

<h3>Libraries</h3>

<p>Certain methods are so common and so useful that over the decades
the code for these has been developed carefully and optimized into
collections known as libraries.  A library can be viewed as a
catenation of object code files with a TOC up front.

<p>In Linux, library files have names ending with the extension .so
and in Windows .dll.  These are essential in that the absence of any
such file will cause the launch of a program to fail.  </p>

<p>Programs are typically dynamically linked with the many
widely-known libaries.  The command ldd displays the list of such
libraries.

<pre>
% ldd /bin/ls
 linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fffcdfff000)
 libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007fdcbca3e000)
 librt.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 (0x00007fdcbc836000)
 libacl.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libacl.so.1 (0x00007fdcbc62d000)
 libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fdcbc26e000)
 libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fdcbc06a000)
 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fdcbcc93000)
 libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fdcbbe4c000)
 libattr.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libattr.so.1 (0x00007fdcbbc47000)
</pre>

<p>The program file /bin/ls does not duplicate the code of the methods it
uses from these libaries.  These are linked at run-time as needed in
the process image of the program.  The content of /bin/ls remains
as-was.  It is possible to statically link every thing by changing
relevant settings in the IDE or linker.  Obviously, a statically
linked program file will be much larger.

<h3>System Calls</h3>

Every OS includes methods that are intended to be called by processes.
These methods cause a change of mode: the process may be in the
so-called "user" (or unprivileged) mode, and this call of an OS
internal method causes the process to enter into a "kernel"
(i.e. privileged) mode for the duration of this method.  Such calls
are known as <i>system calls</i>.  To support this, all modern CPUs
have special instructions variously called INTerrupt, trap, svc
(supervisor call), distinct from an instruction, usually labeled CALL,
that calls another method.

<p> A typical example of system calls are following four on files:
open a file, read the next several bytes of a file, write the next
several bytes of a file, close the file.
</p>

<p>Both OS have some 300+ system calls.  These can be invoked
directly, but more commonly the system calls are wrapped inside more
convenient library methods.
</p>

<h3>"Interoperability" of Programs</h3>

<p>
Consider the file <tt>/bin/ls</tt>.  This is a program in the Linux
OS.  Suppose we copy this file over to Windows -- no changes,
byte-for-byte an exact copy.  Windows refuses to recognize this as a
program.    Obviously a program contains the machine code specific to
a CPU.  So if we move a program from an Intel CPU machine to an ARM
CPU machine, it cannot be invoked.

<p>
A program is a file with a rigorous structure at the level of byte
sequences.  Standards such as ELF and COFF describe this structure.
Humans do not construct programs "by hand" any more -- Linkers do.
class of programs

<p>In recent years, virtual machines, and emulators of immense
capabilities have appeared.  E.g., It is possible to a run a Linux
program, as-is, on Windows and vice-versa.  Examples of such software:
virtualbox, wine, qemu, crossover.

<h2>Directories of Programs</h2>

<p>What does installing a program do? install, *.deb, *.rpm.  *.msi,
installable *.exe files.  

<p>Programs are <i>installed</i> into specific directories.  An
installation package is a "bundle" of files.  In Linux, the "tar ball"
is used.  In Windows, a zip, an .msi, or even a specially constructed
.exe is used.  Installation is performed by invoking a special program
(for now, let us call it the installer).  This involves unbundling the
files, and moving the files into the destination directories.  Before
such an installation, the installer checks the veracity of the
package.  The details of installer will be discussed further under the
heading of Sys Admin.</p>

<p>The standard directories are shown below.  The rows are roughly
aligned based on their functionality.  The /usr/bin and C:\Program
Files directories contain applications.  The /sbin, /usr/sbin,
C:\Windows\system32 contain system programs.

<p>In tables such as the above, some entries are/will-be blank.  This
does not mean that the OS cannot do the equivalent.  It simply means
that the standard installation did/does not come with an equivalent
program.  There is a well-known subsystem
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"> http://www.cygwin.com/</a> that runs
under Windows providing most of Linux functionality, using the program
names of Linux.  On our lab machines, cygwin is installed, but these
are clearly not Winodws-native.
</p>

<p>Linux includes many utilities for extracting information about the
contents of files. Two of the most important are <tt>file</tt>
and <tt>size</tt>.</p>

<p><tt>file FILENAME...</tt> will output the type of the given
files, such as &quot;ASCII text&quot; or &quot;MP3 file with ID3
version 2.3.0 tag&quot;. It does this by examining certain distinctive
patterns of bytes within a file (called the type's
<i>magic number</i>), and can often get quite detailed information.</p>

<p><tt>size</tt> outputs information about object files or
compiled executables, such as those produced by GCC. Specifically, it
lists the sizes of the various <i>sections</i> of the object file. The
&quot;text&quot; section is the code, &quot;data&quot; contains data
which is initialized, and &quot;bss&quot; is the uninitialized part of
the data segment. (Recall the difference between initializing a
variable and merely declaring it from CS240.)</p>

<h2>System Programs v. Applications</h2>

<p>
System Programs are programs that are essential to the OS.  Their
absence will cause significant loss of OS functionality.  E.g., the
"login" program/process takes the userid and password of a user and
instantiates a working session for the user.  The "loader"
program/process loads the program file into memory in preparation to
giving birth to the corresponding process.  The "ifconfig" assigns an
IP address to a/the network card.  The "mount" makes file volumes
accessible.  In Linux, system programs are located in /sbin, and
/usr/sbin.  In Windows, system programs are located in C:\Windows, and
C:\Windows\system32.

<p>
Unfortunately some non-systems programs slip into these directories.
Whereas C:\Windows\regedit.exe is a system program, e.g.,
C:\Windows\write.exe and C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe are rather
trivial applications.

<p>Over this decade, some programs that used to be considered system
programs are now viewed as applications.  Shells (graphical or not,
such as bash, explorer), compilers, linkers are applications.

<h1><a name="Processes">Processes</a></h1>

<p>A successful <i>invocation</i> of a program results in a process.
The invocation is typically done either via a shell (cmd, PowerShell
or bash) or a menu system (which is a &quot;graphical&quot; shell).
Internally, the shells make a system call (built into the OS) that
accomplishes this.  More technically, in response to an <i>exec system
call</i>, the OS <i>loads</i> the program into main memory, constructs
certain OS-internal data structures.  The resulting entity is called
a <i>process</i>.  A process is a dynamic (i.e., changing/active)
entity.</p>

<p>The word &quot;load&quot; is a highly technical term and, at the
level of CEG 2350, a difficult one to describe.  Often students are
confuse linking with loading.  Adding to this confusion are the terms
static and ynamic prefixed to both.  Static linking is a compile-time
activity; per program, we need only do this once.  When a program is
invoked, static loading brings the entire program into memory before
the resulting process begins its execution.  In dynamic loading, only
portions are brought in as needed, and some portions of the program
may never be brought in.  Static loading is an activity that happens
just before running.  Dynamic linking links all the object code files
together into a program but postpones linking the methods of the
libraries; such a program file is considerably smaller than an
equivalent statically linked program.  Dynamic linking and loading
happens during running of the process.</p>

<p>The loader program/process is often invisible to the users.  In
Linux, the programs named ld.so and ld-linux accomplish the dynamic
linking and loading as part of the exec system call.

<p>The main(argc, argv, envp) method of a freshly created process is
supplied three arguments by the invoker process.  The argv is a vector
of pointers to strings, argc a count of items in argv[], and envp a
pointer a an array of characters known as the environment.  A shell (a
CLI, or GUI shell such as explorer) facilitates the construction of
these arguments from keyboard/ mouse/ user given input.
The <i>environment</i> is the set of string variables available to all
processes. In Linux, <tt>env</tt> command displays the environment
and the <tt>set</tt> command manipulates it.</p>

<p>Since all programs can access the environment string, it's
frequently used as a way to supply options to commands without
repeating them every time the command is invoked. (<tt>ls</tt>
reads <tt>LS_OPTIONS</tt>, for example).</p>

<p>Other examples of values commonly stored in the environment are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>HISTSIZE</tt>: the number of items to store
    in <tt>~/.bash_history</tt> (or <tt>HISTFILE</tt>)</li>
  <li><tt>PATH</tt>: the path searched for commands by the shell</li>
  <li><tt>PWD</tt>: the current working directory</li>
  <li><tt>PS1</tt>: the format of the command prompt</li>
  <li><tt>DISPLAY</tt>: the computer on which to show X programs</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a Linux/Windows convention that all global environment
variable names be upper-case.</p>

<p>In bash and in powershell, environment variables may be manipulated
just like any other shell variable.  In bash, e.g., <tt>
PATH=$PATH:~/bin</tt> appends the user's own <tt>bin</tt>
directory to the path.</p>

<h2>Process Management</h2>

A primary fucntion of any OS is: Given a program, create a process and
run it.  Both OS Concepts and Usage run many processes "simultaneouly" and
strive to guarantee that no process interferes with another, that each
is given a fair share of resources, and given the hardware, the
overall performance is maximized.


<h3>Process States</h3>

<p>Lecture Outline: Process states: Read-to-run, Running, Waiting for
an event, swapped out.  State transitions occur as a result of process
scheduling by the OS.  Preemption.  Priorities.  See the Required
Reading.
<img src="./process-states-wiki.png">
from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_states">
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_states</a>
</p>

<h3>Resources Used by Processes</h3>

<p>Every process consumes some resources.  The most obvious ones are
CPU time, memory, open files, and devices.  No process is able to
"get" them unless they request the OS. These are granted to the
processes as requested/ needed/ available by the OS.</p>

<p>Every process begins with an <i>Open File Table</i> containing
three entries in indices 0, 1 and 2.  The &quot;stdout&quot; and
&quot;stdin&quot; are the normal text input and output of commands,
i.e.  what shows up in the terminal. C++ programmers can think of them
as like &quot;cout&quot; and &quot;cin&quot;. There is also a
&quot;stderr&quot; for the output of error messages.  The shell
usually refers to them by number: stdin == 0, stdout == 1, and stderr
== 2.  The stdin is initially bound to the keyboard; the stdout and
stderr are initially bound to the screen.  When additional files are
opened these are inserted into the Open File Table; as files get
closed, these are vacated.  So, at any given moment, the Open File
Table may not be contiguously filled.  There is a limit on the size of
this table imposed by the sys admin of the system; typically, it is
around 30.</p>

<h4>Signals and the Kill Command</h4>

<p><b>Syntax:</b> <tt>kill -[SIGNAL] PID...</tt></p>

<p>Despite its name, ending processes is only one function of
the <tt>kill</tt> command. More generally, it sends <i>signals</i>
to processes (i.e., it raises exceptions). Programs can either catch
these signals and handle them gracefully, or allow the operating
system default to handle them.</p>
<p>The default signal sent by kill is SIGTERM. A different signal can
be given before the PIDs, either by number (<tt>kill -1</tt>) or
by name (with or without the &quot;SIG&quot;, <tt>kill -HUP</tt>
and <tt>kill -SIGHUP</tt> both work).</p>

<p>Signals are sent for other events besides the user
running <tt>kill</tt>.  Many of the most common signals are never
sent directly by users except when testing. Bugs in a program may
cause it to terminate with SIGSEGV, and pressing control-c usually
sends SIGINT, for example.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, signal numbers vary between Unix flavors. The most
common signals usually stay the same, but it's a good idea to
check <tt>kill -l</tt> for supported signals. Further, although
many systems provide convenience utilities for common tasks, they
sometimes have different effects when moving between systems. For
example, the command that kills all processes matching a certain name
on Linux will end <i>all</i> running processes on Solaris!</p>

<h3><a name="Windows_PsTools">Windows PsTools</a></h3>

<p>The tools needed for Linux are readily present in a
  typical Linux distribution, but the tools needed for Windows (known
  as <i>PsTools)</i> need to be downloaded from
  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649">
  http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/</a> None of the
  tools requires any special installation. The tools included in
  the <i>PsTools</i> suite are: </p>

<p>(The author of the above alerts us that some anti-virus scanners
  may report that one or more of the tools are infected with a
  &quot;remote admin&quot; virus.  None of the PsTools contain
  viruses, but they have been used by viruses, which is why they
  trigger virus notifications.)  See the References below.</p>
