1. Our goal in this part of the course is to have the WhiteBoard, we
   have been discussing, re-done in Java.  Its functionality should be
   the same as P1 that was done in C-RPC.
1. Slides [[./matetiJavaRMI.pptx]] 
1. [[../Projects/WB-Java-RMI/html/index.html]] Java code htmlized by
   doxygen.  This is ideal for reading the Java src code.
1. [[../Projects/WB-Java-RMI.tbz]] tar ball of Java src code.  Expands to
   WhiteBoard/ that can build to P0, equivalent to P0-in-C-RPC.  No
   assertions.  You need to extend P0 to P1.  [If you wish, start with
   your own Java P0.]
