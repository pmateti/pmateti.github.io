Considering a group of 5 people (X1, X2, X3, X4,X5) , X1 wants to share a file (F1) with
others. X1 will apply secret sharing scheme on F1 and create 5 shares (S1, S2, S3, S4,
S5). These shares are uploaded in IPFS. The hash that generated by IPFS will be given
to the group. Each individual of the group will maintain a chain that stores hash of the
share along with the file ID.
Workflow
 Split the file into shares
 Add shares to IPFS
 Update the chain
 Retrieve on demand basis
Split the file into shares
 By applying the secret sharing scheme (1,3,5) [where file is divided into 5 shares
among 3 is required to regenerate the file]
One among the share is essential
 Should not be viewed by anyone except the owner
 Reveal on demand
Other shares can be viewed by anyone
Add shares to IPFS
Updation of chain
Each Xi will update the chain with the file ID and IPFS hash of S i
Retrieve On demand basis
When some nodes want to recreate the file the shares need to recombined with
essential share
Queries:
 Is the path traceable using DHT? ( as DHT stores the pointer to the node that stores
digital object). If it is traceable, attack ( Content reveal) is possible
 When the node Pinned the digital objects, Unpinned the same, will the content be still
available?(........because in IPFS the data lives forever)
Work Done
Step 1: Installed IPFS in two Systems (consider as node A and Node B) that were in
same subnet (Intranet)
Step 2: Initiated Daemon – Viewed
Peer ID
Public Key
Private Key
Exported the IPFS to different path and viewed
Modification Observed in above all 3 parameters
When a new terminal is opened and IPFS id is given it will display the initial ID
Query 1: Is the peer ID is unique
                 Yes, Peer ID is unique for the system/ Node. Though multiple export
action performed finally when we tried to retrieve IPFS ID, the initial value is displayed
( peer id generated at the time of initial installation)
Query 2: Replace the config file and verify the peer ID is over written or not
Step 3: Added files to IPFS and viewed
once a file is added, hash is generated and displayed
Hash is used for retrieving
Pin ( recursive and indirect) and Unpin the file
Query 3: When a node is down/ disconnected from network, will be able to get the
content pinned by that node?
                 Yes, it is possible to retrieve the content
