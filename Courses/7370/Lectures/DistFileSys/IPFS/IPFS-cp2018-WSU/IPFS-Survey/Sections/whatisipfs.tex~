Many of the terms used below are explained in detail in the Background
section.

IPFS is a distributed file system.  Currently (2018), only an alpha

| TEDxSanFrancisco Juan explains why the web is in danger and how
there's an open source movement focused on creating a new way of
sharing knowledge is building the Interplanetary Files System
(IPFS).The Interplanetary Files System (IPFS), an open source movement
focused on creating a new way of sharing knowledge.

IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing
devices with the same system of files.  In some ways, this is similar
to the original aims of the Web, but IPFS is actually more similar to
a single bittorrent swarm exchanging git objects. IPFS could become a
new major subsystem of the internet. If built right, it could
complement or replace HTTP. It could complement or replace even
more. It sounds crazy. It is crazy.‚Äù[1]

``IPFS is a global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. It combines
good ideas from Git, BitTorrent, Kademlia, SFS, and the web. It is
like a single bittorrent swarm, exchanging git objects. IPFS provides
an interface as simple as the HTTP web, but with permanence built
in. You can also mount the world at /ipfs.IPFS could become a new
major subsystem of the internet. If built right, it could complement
or replace HTTP.''

``IPFS is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.''

``Most people aren't running IPFS nodes, and IPFS isn't seen yet as a
valuable resource by censors. So they'll probably just block the whole
domain, and now people won't know about or download IPFS. We saw this
progression with GitHub in China.''
