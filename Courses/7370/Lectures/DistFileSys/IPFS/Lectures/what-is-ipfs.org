** On to the Content of this Lecture

1. The next few descriptions are loaded with "terminology".
2. Often, Circular.
3. These are going to leave you with a number of questions.
   Wait for FAQ below.


* What does "IPFS" Offer?

# 1. IPFS offers the following, when finished (?).

2. (Linux/ ...) OS File System.
3. Web content: As it is now 2018, Web 2.0, Web 3.0 soon.
4. Globally + Uniformly Network accessible.
1. A platform for Distributed Apps (DApps).

** What is "IPFS"?

1. The current section is a collection of ideas.
1. Together they can be the basis for a future design of web.
1. The next section is a description of IPFS, the specific "product".
1. IPFS, an acronym for "InterPlanetary File System".

** Object Storage

1. Digital Objects are stored in "nodes": distributed across the
   globe, decentralized.
1. The "FS" in the name does /not/ stand, strictly, for files.
1. A "file" is any digital object, small or large.
1. Objects are stored in a MerkleDAG.

** Addressing Stored Values

*** Arrays and Indices

1. =a[x]=
1. array name a, 
1. index integer x, 
1. x >= 0 mostly.
1. address of a[x+1] == address of a[x] + size-of(a[x])

*** Associative Arrays

1. a  collection of pairs (x, a[x]) of indices x and values a[x]
1. unordered
1. no duplicated indices
1. cache memory
1. Often drawn as an array, but no address relationships among elements

*** Key-Value Stores

1. Generalize the indices in assoc arrays to arbitrary types called
   /keys/.
1. No address relationships among elements.
1. Given a key =k=, retrieve value =val(k)=
1. https://redis.io/ | https://memcached.org/

** Location Based Addressing

1. Web 1.0/ 2.0 URLs have the following syntax: =scheme: //[userName=
   =[:password@]] serverMachineName [:port]/ [path] [/resource]= 
   =[?parm1=parma &parm2=parmb]=

1. A simple example of the above is http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/
   where the scheme was chosen to be =http=, the port defaults to 80,
   and the path given is =~pmateti/=.

** Content-Hash Addressed

1. Apply a crypto-hash (e.g., sha256) to the content, resulting in, e.g.,
   =QmZpfhN5rucQC4kx7Gu5udS8FXxsxMddiDCvG8WFjG8SMv=
1. The above is in /multihash/ self-describing format and Base58
   encoding. The letters =Qm= correspond to SHA-256 and 32 byte
   length.
1. IPFS makes sure the hash is unique.

1. An IPFS address hash should be stored in =bytes=.  The =Qm...=
   should be stored as a =string=.
1. IPFS link
   =/ipfs/QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ/cat.jpg=

1. =http://localhost:8080/ipfs/QmR96iiRBEroYAe955my8cdHkK4kAu6SApGC2eS5kSzHwt/=

*** MultiHash

1. struct Multihash
   : struct Multihash {
   :   bytes32 hash
   :   uint8 hash_function
   :   uint8 size
   : }

1. ipfs add -w example.txt
   : $ ipfs add -w example.txt
   : added QmbFMke1KXqnYyBBWxB74N4c5SBnJMVAiMNRcGu6x1AwQH example.txt
   : added QmVFDXxAEC5iQ9ptb36dxzpNsQjVatvxhG44wK7PpRzsDE

*** Retrievability

1. To retrieve content, you must have its hash.
1. Ex: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/...
1. User friendly? Work-in-progress.  See IPNS.

** Immutable

1. The content (of a stored object) is unchangeable.

1. The content is versioned, with a link to its previous version.

1. Recall digital ledgers.

1. Deletion? See FAQ.


** Permanency

1. IPFS is a permanent storage system for digital objects.  Lives forever.
1. An object stored in IPFS is retrievable at any time, 24x7, from a node.
1. Motivated by /incentivization/.

** Permissions

1. As long as you have the hash of an object, you can retrieve
   it from IPFS.
1. Can we have at least Linux-style read-write-etc permissions? WIP.
1. FAQ: Public v Private IPFS.


** Ownership

1. What is ownership?  Define.  Related to immutability.
1. No single entity, human or org, owns the system, or any part of it.
1. No "destructive" operations can be performed.
1. FAQ: Who uploaded what?


** Decentralized + Distributed

1. "It's nowhere because it's everywhere!"
1. Sanskrit: Sarvantaryami (in Telugu script సర్వాంతర్యామి)

*** Client-Server v P2P

#+caption: Client-Server v P2P
#+attr_html: :alt Client-Server v P2P  :title Client-Server v P2P
[[../Figures/networksv4.png]]

*** Centralized Decentralized Distributed

#+caption: Centralized Decentralized Distributed
#+attr_html: :alt Centralized Decentralized Distributed  :title Centralized Decentralized Distributed :width 100%
[[../Figures/decentral-distributed.png]]


*** Distributed

1. Spatially Distributed
1. Possibly replicated
1. We use duplication versus replication with different semantics.
1. Sharded content?

*** Decentralized

1. Harder to define.
1. Centralized: One node exists that controls all content.
1. Multiple centers.
1. Decentralized: Single or multiple centers do not exist.


*** Decentralized implies Distributed

*** Distributed does-not-imply Decentralized

** Network Accessible Uniformly

1. All IPFS nodes access the objects using the same addresses.
1. No client is denied access.
1. Performance can vary.

** Security

1. "Security" is an ill defined term, in general.  So, let us focus on
   the following aspects.
1. Unauthorized content modification: Not possible.
1. Read-Access control Built-in: Non existent.
1. Read-Access control DIY: Encrypt the object and share the (private) key.

1. [[https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/learn-to-securely-share-files-on-the-blockchain-with-ipfs-219ee47df54c][Learn to securely share on the IPFS]].

* What is IPFS?

1. A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol: =ipfs:/.../...=.  
1. A (networked) storage system that can be =mount= -ed.
1. Funding: $52 million from Union Square Ventures (??) and others.
1. IPFS is FOSS.
1. This section is a sketchy design description.

** Technologies Used/ Related

1. DHT Distributed Hash Tables - Kademlia 
1. Block Exchanges - BitTorrent
1. Version Control Systems, merkledag - Git
1. Self-certifying File System SFS
1. FileCoin

** Nodes

1. A node is a computer system running the "IPFS daemon": =ipfs init=
1. A node stores IPFS objects.
1. Obviously, not all of them.
1. No assumptions are made about the life-cycle of a node.
1. A node is a running process that can find, publish, and replicate
   merkledag objects.

*** Nodes #2

1. Access requests originate from a node.
1. Retrieved content is cached.
1. Idle cached content is garbage collected.
1. Nodes cannot be forced to fetch anything or to pin anything.
1. A node uses the DHT, IPLD, IPNS -- see below.

*** Nodes #3

1. There are already many (thousands?) nodes.

1. Content becomes more readily available as it gets more
   popular.

1. Often content "cannot" be reached.

** IPFS Layers (Subsystems)

** IPLD InterPlanetary Linked Data

#+caption: InterPlanetary Linked Data
#+attr_html: :alt  :title InterPlanetary Linked Data :width 50%
[[../Figures/ipld-illustration.svg]]

*** IPLD InterPlanetary Linked Data

1. IPLD InterPlanetary Linked Data https://github.com/ipld
1. "IPLD is the data model of the content-addressable web. It allows us
   to treat all hash-linked data structures as subsets of a unified
   information space, unifying all data models that link data with
   hashes as instances of IPLD."

1. "IPLD is a single namespace for all hash-inspired
   protocols.  Through IPLD, links can be traversed across protocols,
   allowing you explore data regardless of the underlying protocol."

** LIBP2P

#+caption: libp2p included protocols

*** LIBP2P #2

#+caption: libp2p routing
#+attr_html: :alt IPFS Layers :title IPFS Layers :width 100%
[[../Figures/libp2p.003.jpg]]

** DHT Distributed Hash Tables

1. DHT: Given the Key, retrieve Value.
1. Similar to Python dict or Perl hash.  Not (necessarily) crypto-hash.
1. The DHT may be distributed over multiple nodes.
1. Multiple designs/ implementations exist: e.g., Kademlia.
1. IPFS key is crypto-hash of object content.

** IPFS Networking

1. "IPFS nodes communicate regularly with hundreds of other nodes in
   the network."

*** IPFS Routing

1. IPFS nodes require a routing system that can find (a) other peers’
   network addresses and (b) peers who can serve particular objects. 

1. IPFS achieves this using a DHT.

*** DHT Interface

: type IPFSRouting interface {
:   FindPeer(node NodeId) // gets a particular peer’s network address
:   SetValue(key []bytes, value []bytes) // stores a small metadata value in DHT
:   GetValue(key []bytes) // retrieves small metadata value from DHT
:   ProvideValue(key Multihash) // announces this node can serve a large value
:   FindValuePeers(key Multihash, min int) // gets a number of peers serving a large value
: }

** IPFS Exchange

1. In IPFS, data distribution happens by exchanging blocks with peers
   using BitSwap.

1. BitSwap nodes provide direct values to each other in the form of blocks.

1. BitSwap nodes keep ledgers accounting the transfers with other nodes


** IPNS  InterPlanetary Naming System

1. The Peer ID is the hash of the public RSA key of the node.  IPNS
   maps peer IDs to content hashes.
1. The mapping can be modified.
: ipfs name publish QmNUhKfcGJyQJnZu3AKn8NoiomDwDCRBicgqPt1YRqJBCz
: Published to QmYmmfn68vkcFDeZz1NTZyEXTixjjUnUS6UaPdMSsUBWxs:
:  /ipfs/QmNUhKfcGJyQJnZu3AKn8NoiomDwDCRBicgqPt1YRqJBCz
1. In the above, =QmYmmfn68vkcFDeZz1NTZyEXTixjjUnUS6UaPdMSsUBWxs= was
   the peer ID.
1. IPFS stores the private RSA key in the configuration. No
   passphrase.

*** Readability
[[../Figures/human-readable.png]]

*** Readability #2

[[../Figures/ipld-foo-bar-baz.png]]


*** IPFS Naming

1. Bind IPNS to a domain using DNS TXT records

*** IPFS MerkleDAG

#+caption: A Merkle Bin Tree of Four Blocks
#+attr_html: :alt A Merkle Bin Tree  :title A Merkle Bin Tree :width 100%
[[../Figures/merkle-bin-tree.png]]

*** Details of MerkleDAG

1. Merkle trees in general are n-ary.
1. A forest is a collection of trees.
1. Merkle Trees are already in use by Git, BitCoin, Ethereum, ...

*** IPFS Digital Objects

1. block: a variable-size chunk of data.  An addressable unit of data.

2. list: a collection of blocks or other lists.
3. tree: a collection of blocks, lists, or other trees.
4. commit: a snapshot in the version history of a tree.

** IPFS Applications
