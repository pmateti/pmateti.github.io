  <li>(10*5 points each) The following statements may or may not be
  (fully or partially) valid.&nbsp; First, explain the
  term <i><u>underlined</u></i> in the statement.&nbsp; Then, explain/
  discuss/ dispute the statement.&nbsp; It is <i> possible</i> to
  write no more than, say, five, sentences each, and yet receive full
  score.
    <ol type="i">
      <li><u>Hackers</u>, as distinct from attackers, do have
	ethics.</li>
      <li>Spoofing and <u>Smurfing</u> are IP exploits. </li>
      <li>A firewall can be configured to prevent <u>IP
	  spoofing.</u></li>
      <li><u>One Time Passwords</u> require you to request the
      sysadmin for a new password after each login.
      </li>
      <li><u>Race conditions</u> cannot happen if we get rid off the
      creation of temporary files.  </li>
      <li><u>Proper configuration</u> of a freshly installed system
	must be done with the system disconnected from all
	networking.</li>
      <li>No amount of <u>hardening</u> can prevent security incidents
	from happening.  </li>
      <li>For something to be called a <u>virus</u>, it must embed in
	such a way that it is executed only intermittently.</li>
      <li> <u>Address Space Layout Randomization</u> (ASLR) helps prevent 
	buffer overflow exploits.</li>
      <li>Without <u>assertions</u> the source code anlaysis tool
	Splint produces false-positives.</li>

<li>(5*10 points)
<ol type="i">
  <li>AlephOne describes
    the <tt>eggshell </tt>&nbsp;program as <tt>&quot;usage:
    eggshell [-a &lt;alignment&gt;] [-b &lt;buffersize&gt;] [-e
    &lt;eggsize&gt;] [-o &lt;offset&gt;]\n</tt>&quot;.&nbsp; What
    are <tt> &lt;alignment&gt;, </tt> and<tt>
    &lt;eggsize&gt;</tt> and why do we need them? </li>

  <li>Describe any two of the Principles of Robust
    Programming of Matt Bishop's article.</li>

  <li>Using a C source code level example, explain the Time of
    Check/Time of Use (TOCTOU) exploit.  Syntax errors will be
    forgiven.
  </li>

<li>Describe, on a technical level, a significant security incident
  that happened in the last 12 months.  Excluded: Flame, StuxNet.


  <li>It is well-known that a large percentage of systems remain
    vulnerable long after security patches have been issued because
    the patches have not been applied.&nbsp; Mr. Means Well, a
    security expert, got tired of this situation, and wrote a
    worm-like system, MWP, that applies patches without engaging in a
    dialog with the sysadmin.&nbsp; The MWP examines the system that
    it is currently on, fetches all relevant patches from reputable
    web sites, verifies their digital signatures, applies them to the
    current system, and mails a detailed log of what files were
    modified to the sysadmin.&nbsp; It then spreads to other
    systems.&nbsp; What are the ethical issues raised by MWP?&nbsp;
    Would you support it?&nbsp; Or would you take precautions to
    thwart it?&nbsp; Discuss.</ol>
