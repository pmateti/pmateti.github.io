<li> (10 points) Describe a significant security incident that
  happened in the last 12 months.


  <li>(10 points)&nbsp; It is well-known that a large percentage of
    systems remain vulnerable long after security patches have been
    issued because the patches have not been applied.&nbsp; Mr. Means
    Well, a security expert, got tired of this situation, and wrote a
    worm-like system, MWP, that applies patches without engaging in a
    dialog with the sysadmin.&nbsp; The MWP examines the system that
    it is currently on, fetches all relevant patches from reputable
    web sites, verifies their digital signatures, applies them to the
    current system, and mails a detailed log of what files were
    modified to the sysadmin.&nbsp; It then spreads to other
    systems.&nbsp; What are the ethical issues raised by MWP?&nbsp;
    Would you support it?&nbsp; Or would you take precautions to
    thwart it?&nbsp; Discuss.</ol>
