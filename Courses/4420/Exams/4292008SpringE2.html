  <li>(6*5 points each) The following statements may or may not be (fully or 
  partially) valid.&nbsp; First, explain the term <i><u>underlined</u></i> in the 
  statement.&nbsp; Then, explain/ discuss/ dispute the statement.&nbsp; It is <i>
  possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten, sentences each, and yet receive 
  full score.
  <ol type="a">
    <li>&nbsp;An <u><i>IP filtering package</i></u> must be run on a router.&nbsp; It has no effect 
    if run on a normal host with a single network card. </li>
    <li><u><i>Hackers</i></u>, as distinct from attackers, do have  ethics.</li>
    <li><u><i>TCP sequence numbers</i></u> start out with a random number, and 
	incremented randomly so that they are unpredictable.</li>
    <li>WEP of 802.11 uses <i><u>SSID</u></i> as the shared key.</li>
    <li>A <i><u>rootkit</u></i> is a collection of short programs used by super-users to 
    repair the damage done by an intruder.</li>
    <li>For something to be called a <i><u>virus</u></i>, it must  embed in such 
    a way that it is executed only intermittently.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>(20 points) Describe, in detail,&nbsp; the techniques used in&nbsp; <code>
	hijack</code>.&nbsp; Give technical details with&nbsp; real or cooked-up but 
	realistic numbers for the fields of relevant TCP segments.<li>(40 points)
<ol type="a">
<li>(10 points) Describe how stack top randomization makes buffer overflow 
exploits difficult.<li>(10 points) AlephOne describes the <code>eggshell </code>&nbsp;program 
as <code>&quot;usage: eggshell [-a 
  &lt;alignment&gt;] [-b &lt;buffersize&gt;] [-e &lt;eggsize&gt;] [-o &lt;offset&gt;]\n</code>&quot;.&nbsp;  What are <code>
&lt;alignment&gt;, </code>

  <li>(10 points) Describe the Principles of Robust Programming of Matt Bishop's 
	article.</li>
<li>(2*5 points) Consider the routine shown below.&nbsp; It reads a file name 
  from the standard input and returns its protection mode.

  <li>(10 points)&nbsp; It is well-known that a large percentage of systems remain 
	vulnerable long after security patches have been issued because the patches 
	have not been applied.&nbsp; Mr. Means Well, a security expert, got tired of this 
	situation, and wrote a worm-like system, MWP, that applies patches without 
	engaging in a dialog with the sysadmin.&nbsp; The MWP examines the system that it 
	is currently on, fetches all relevant patches from reputable web sites, 
	verifies their digital signatures, applies them to the current system, and 
	mails a detailed log of what files were modified to the sysadmin.&nbsp; It then 
	spreads to other systems.&nbsp; What are the ethical issues raised by MWP?&nbsp; Would 
	you support it?&nbsp; Or would you take precautions to thwart it?&nbsp; Discuss.</ol>
