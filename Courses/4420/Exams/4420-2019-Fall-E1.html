	running Knoppix/ Kali, gcc, ps, splint, etc. but *not* man

    <p>Please record your
      effort in minutes for each of the ten items below.  Other
      feedback you wish to give is also welcome.</p>
    <h2>Part I (5 points each)</h2>
    <p>The following statements may or may not be (fully or partially)
	valid.  Explain the underlined technical term</i> occurring in
	each statement.  Explain/ discuss/ dispute the statement.  It
	is <i>possible</i> to write no more than, say, ten, sentences

/bin/ls</pre></td></tr></table> The numbers shown yesterday were
    different.  OMG! We have been compromised!

  <li> A <u>rootkit</u> is a collection of (short or long) programs
    used by super-users to repair the damage done by an intruder.
  <li><u>Backdoors</u> are used to install rootkits.
	<li>From the content of <tt> <u>/proc/1</u></tt> we can
	  get the exact path name of the <tt>init</tt>.

	<li>Consider the following
	  programs: <tt>/bin/mount</tt>, <tt>/bin/umount</tt>,
    <tt>/usr/bin/sudo</tt>, <tt>/bin/cat</tt>,
    <tt>/usr/lib/virtualbox/VirtualBox</tt>.  It is
    justifiable that they should all be given <u>suid</u> root
    permissions.
</ol>

<h2>Part II (15 points each)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Consider the following ten significant events that occur in
	  the rebooting of a Linux machine, currently running, from power on
	  to login prompt. The events may or may not have occurred in the
	  order given.  Other (significant) events not mentioned may have
	  happened. <b>E1</b>: Root volume is mounted by the
	  kernel; <b>E2</b>: Process <tt>init</tt> is created;
	  <b>E3</b>: OS boot loader reads the kernel image; <b>E4</b>:
	  OS Boot loader invokes the kernel; <b>E5</b>: several more
	  processes are started.  <b>E6</b>: Several processes whose
	  names are enclosed in brackets are
	  started; <span style="background-color:yellowTBD"> (To see
	    bracketed ones, list all processes.)</span>
    <b>E7</b>: BIOS/ UEFI finds the boot device. <b>E8</b>: OS
	  boot loader is discovered; <b>E9</b>: All file volumes are
	  unmounted.  <b>E10</b>: <tt>init</tt> is terminated.  (i) (10
	  points) Order these events chronologically. (ii) (5 points) Explain
	  step <b>E1</b> further, and describe how security may have been
	  breached in this step.

  <li>Compile the file
	  <a href=../Lectures/BufferOverflow/AlephOne/C-AlephOne/testsc.c>testsc.c</a>
	  of AlephOne, and run <tt>testsc</tt> under <tt>strace</tt> in
	  a modern Linux. (i) (5 points) Did the shell code get
	  executed?  Explain fully.  (ii) (10 points) Explain the
	  details of any two of the system calls s-traced.

  <li> In developing the various versions of exploitN.c, AlephOne
    wishes to avoid the occurrence of 0x00 in the shellcode[].
    Why?  How does he avoid it?

  <li> The ascii diagram below is from the paper by AlephOne.  Explain
    fully the arrow labeled (3).

    code warnings</a>.  Take the two warnings on lines 32 and 52, and

    warnings no longer apply.  Re-run splint on the revised
    exploit3.c, and include the output in the <tt>mtanswers.pdf</tt>.
