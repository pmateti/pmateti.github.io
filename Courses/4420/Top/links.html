    &quot;Full disclosure of security issues is the only effective way
    to both push the development of secure software and to ensure that
    issues are rapidly identified and resolved. To that end, Packet
    Storm is firmly committed to archiving and providing the most
    complete set of security tools and papers available to the
    technical community at large, irrespective of commercial,
    political, or any other bias.&quot;&nbsp; Also is a source code
    archive of tools and exploits.</li>

    technical information that can be used by bad guys for malicious

 <b><a href="http://">alt.hackers</a> </b>A newsgroup where hackers discuss what they do 
 best. Here hackers gather to share information about hacking and cracking.</p>
<p>
 <b><a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9509/sec7/art25.htm">Noted and Notorious Hacker Feats</a></b>&nbsp; 
 Byte magazine article of&nbsp; <strong><font size="-1">
 <a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9509/9509.htm" tppabs="/art/9509/9509.htm">September 
 1995 </a>/ <a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9509/sec7/sec7.htm" 
 tppabs="/art/9509/sec7/sec7.htm">20th Anniversary</a></font></strong>. Hackerdom is 
 divided into two parts: technologically adept and clever people, who could write a 
 computer game in a night, and, sadly, irresponsible slime balls, who hijack computer and 
 phone systems for the heck of it. This is a look at some of the amazing stunts that have 
 been pulled by both hackers and crackers.<br>
</p>
<p>
 <b><a href="http://www.hackerz.org">Hacker Defense Foundation</a> </b>is a Not-for-Profit 
 foundation dedicated and committed to the advancement of the hacking community, through 
 education, of the social, political, and legal implications of the uses of technology, 
 and seeks to enlighten the public and law enforcement about hacking community, through 
 education, that hackers are not the lawless goons that law enforcement, the news media, 
 and Hollywood would try to portray them as.&nbsp; The Hacker's Defense Foundation does 
 not condone, support, or defend criminal acts. </p>
<p>
 <b><a href="http://www.securityserver.com/cgi-local/ssis.pl/docs/hacker7.htm">Computer 
 Break-Ins: A Case Study</a></b><br>
 Computer break-ins are getting more common every day. Log files and even program binaries 
 are changed, making it very hard for the system administrators to assess the damage and 
 track down the intruders. This paper describes the modus operandi of hackers based on 
 multiple hacking attempts that occurred during this year at some department computers. 
 Special attention is paid to the methods they use to break into computer systems and what 
 they do once they are in.<br>

 <b><a href="http://www.2600.com">2600: The Hacker Quarterly</a></b> Home of the hacking 
 magazine.&nbsp; 2600 is one of the oldest hacking groups.<br>

 <b><a href="http://www.happyhacker.org">The Happy Hacker Home Page</a></b><br>

 issues and harmless hacking without breaking laws.<br>

 <b><a href="http://sun.soci.niu.edu/theses/gordon">The Social
 Organization of The Computer Underground</a></b><br> This paper
 examines the social organization of the &quot;computer
 underground&quot; (CU). The CU is composed of actors in three roles,
 &quot;computer hackers,&quot; &quot;phone phreaks,&quot; and
 &quot;software pirates.&quot; These roles have frequently been
 ignored or confused in media and other accounts of CU activity. By
 utilizing a data set culled from CU channels of communication this
 paper provides an ethnographic account of computer underground
 organization.<br>

 The United States Vs. Craig Neidorf</a></b><br> Craig Neidorf was a
 college student accused of fraud and interstate transportation of
 stolen property as a result of a document published in his electronic
 newsletter, Phrack.  The case ended after four days of trial when the
 government dropped its charges. The charges against Neidorf came as
 part of a two-year investigation into illegal activity, during which
 the government seized over 40 systems and 23,000 disks.</p>

 <b><a href="http://www.anonymizer.com">The Anonymizer</a></b><br>
 Many people surf the web under the illusion that their actions are private and anonymous. 
 Unfortunately, it isn't so. Every time you visit a site, you leave a calling card that 
 reveals where you're coming from, what kind of computer you have, and other details. Most 
 sites keep logs of all your visits. In many cases, this logging may constitute a 
 violation of your privacy.</p>

    included for background and flavor, it is not a technical
