DNSChanger
http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/notifying-users-affected-by-dnschanger.html
The DNSChanger malware modifies DNS settings to use malicious servers
that point users to fake sites and other harmful locations. DNSChanger
attempts to modify the settings on home routers as well, meaning other
computers and mobile devices may also be affected.  Since the FBI and
Estonian law enforcement arrested a group of people and transferred
control of the rogue DNS servers to the Internet Systems Consortium in
November 2011, various ISPs and other groups have attempted to alert
victims.
