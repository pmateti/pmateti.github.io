      <p>This take-home exam permits the use of a Linux/Windows
	laptop/PC running javac, g++, Eclipse, Idea, and other
	software development and drawing tools.  It is otherwise a
	traditional closed book, closed notes exam.  In particular,
	you are honor bound <i>*not*</i> to Internet surf or access any
	content already existing (other than as indicated) once you
	access the midterm until you turnin the answers.  The primary
	reasons in making this a take-home are to relieve time pressure
	and give you a comfortable (computing/home) environment.  Do
	not give or take help from others.

      <p>Submit your answers by Sat Nov 02, 2013 12:00 noon

    <ol>
      <li>(5 points each) The following statements may or may not be
	(fully or partially) valid.  Explain the underlined technical
	terms</i> occurring in each statement.  Explain/ discuss/
	dispute the statement.  It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
	than, say, five, lines each, and yet receive full score.

	<ol type=i>
	  <li> Suppose we wrote down <u>specs</u> rigorously/
            formally using mathematics and logic,
            and <u>requirements</u> in carefully worded English.
            There is no method other than a judge+jury system to
            decide if these two are consistent with each other.

	  <li> If the <u>pre-condition</u> of a piece of code S
	    is <code>false</code>, we are asserting that S does not
	    terminate and therefore we can have fun and claim a
	    preposterous <u>post-condition</u>.

	  <li>The <u>Design by contract</u> principle is a variation
            of the Liskov Substitution Principle.

	  <li> Once we write a <u>program</u> for a <u>wicked problem</u> it
	    is no longer wicked.

	  <li> Suppose we are revising a 1970s program, that used as
	  little memory as possible, into a modern one, that uses
	  memory liberally, in the hope of significantly improved
	  <u>performance</u>.  We can use the old program as
	  a <u>functional specification</u> for the new one.
      </ol></li>

      <li>(15 points each)

	<ol type="i">
	  <li> Consider our 
            <a href="../Lectures/Worms/worms.cpp.html ">
              Wiggly Worms program</a>.  We can intuitively describe
              the "connectedness" of a worm's body as "we can draw a
              line possibly with a few turns without lifting our pen
              starting from the head body segment to the tail".  State
              this as an assertion using mathematical notations using
              the typedefs originally given or the class definitions
              you have derived from it.
          <li>
            Here is a link to 
            <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/11model/BinarySearch.java.html">
              BinarySearch.java</a>.  Focus on the <code> public
            static int rank(int key, int[] a)</code> method.  Give, in
            JML, its weakest pre-condition and strongest
            post-condition and strongest loop invariant for the while
            loop of the method.  You are welcome to use JML plugin in
            Eclipse or IDEA.

	  <li> Our 
            <a href="../Lectures/Design/small-set.html">
              requirements</a> for the SmallSet of Integers have
	    changed as follows.  (i) It is no longer a set but a bag
	    -- we now want a SmallBag of Integers; (ii) No bigger than
	    1000 elements; unchanged (iii) Deletions (as well as
	    insertions) are frequent ops (iv) item-is-in-the-set(S, e)
	    is now <code>item-is-in-the-bag(S, e)</code> and
	    furthermore not used often (iv) Some ops can "fail", but
	    only if they must.  Modify our SmallSet design so that it
	    is now a SmallBag design.  Present it in a VHLL.  You will
	    lose points if it is almost Java.

	  <li> Give an example OOP program of your own in Java or C++
	    that illustrates the Liskov Substitution Principle.

          <li> A specific hash trie in the context of Common Words Problem
            is shown in 
            <a href="http://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/7140/Notes/cwp-hash-trie.pdf">
              cwp-hash-trie.pdf</a>.  We now insert the word "bend".
              Show the resulting hash trie.
