         Security Through Obscurity
      Use secrecy (of design, implementation, etc.) to ensure
       security.
      May have theoretical or actual security vulnerabilities,
       but its owners or designers believe that the flaws are not
       known, and that attackers are unlikely to find them.
      We really mean "security implemented solely through
       obscurity."
      Obscurity is not always bad.
      Is Obscurity Ever Good?
