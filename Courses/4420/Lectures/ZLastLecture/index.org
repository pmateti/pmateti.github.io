* Agenda

** Think Seriously

1. No one can become a security expert without excellent command over
   OS internals.

1. Command over the C language is essential for security work.

1. Could this course have been taught using Windows instead of Linux?

** Journals

1. Count the number of hours spent in learning the background material
   for a lab?  E.g., understanding the options of various commands?

** Background/ Refreshers

1. What good is googling for answers without an understanding of why
   they are valid or might actually be wrong?

1. Even now, all of   [[../../Lectures/Refreshers/]] is highly recommended.



* Recommended Reading Beyond Lectures

1. A goal of this course is to be aware of current security incidents.
2. At an OS-internals level.  Mostly, Linux based.
1. http://www.phrack.org/issues/69/15.html#article How to hide a hook:
   A hypervisor for rootkits.  Recommended Reading.
