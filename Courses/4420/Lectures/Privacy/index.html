<h1> Security and Privacy on the Web</h1>


<p style="text-align:right">&quot;On the Internet, Nobody knows you're a dog.
True or False?&quot;</p>


<p> Privacy and security are siblings.  The WWW has brought the
Internet to every computer with a modem or a NIC. What is not as

widely known is the loss of privacy and security it has caused. This
lecture describes these issues, and present some measures that
individuals can take.</p>

<p>In the real world you have the power to choose when and to whom you reveal
certain parts of your identity. But on the Internet the digital footprints you
leave can be tracked and compiled without your knowledge or consent.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>&quot;Internet security is akin to a three-tiered cake. The top layer is the
Internet as a network, and this was the weak point hackers exploited in the
February 2000 denial of service attack [on popular Internet sites, including
Yahoo.com and Amazon.com]. The attack was composed of an excessive number of
false, computer-generated hits on a given Web site causing the site to overload,
and become unavailable to customers. The second layer of the cake is
transactional security, or what is commonly called e-commerce and personal
identity. This includes the question of who, really, sent you an email, or whose
Web site are you accessing. The third layer of the Internet security cake is
personal privacy, represented by encryption such as PGP. These three separate
areas are commonly lumped together in discussions but must be understood
independently to properly discern the Internet security issues.&quot;

<h3>Publius Censorship Resistant Publishing System</h3>


with almost no fear of being traced or of having the content removed from the
system without permission.  AT&amp;T is supporting this online system
designed to let Web surfers publish any content without fear of censorship. </p>
<p>Publius works by breaking a file into small pieces, making many different
copies of each piece, and then distributing them individually across a network
of volunteer Web servers. It is like putting a photograph on a jigsaw puzzle,
making copies, taking the puzzle apart, and then hiding all of the individual
pieces.  Using strong encryption, Publius develops the equivalent of a Web
address, or URL, where the content can be &quot;found.&quot; The address
contains coded instructions for finding all the hidden pieces and putting them
back together. The address cannot be used to track down the original author or
to track down all the individual pieces and delete them, however.
<p>Authors can update the content themselves, but the URL coding system can
detect whether unauthorized changes have been made to the content. A setting
also allows the content publishers to keep even themselves from deleting files
from the network, lest they
<p>The Publius software 
 allows anyone with a Wb browser to post a file online,

ease note that there are organizations which include &quot;freenet&quot;
as a substring in their names but unrelated to the following.)</p>
<p>Freenet is a peer-to-peer network designed to allow the distribution of
information over the Internet in an efficient manner, without fear of
censorship.  Freenet is completely decentralized, meaning that there is no
person, computer, or organisation in control of Freenet or essential to its
operation. This means that Freenet cannot be <a
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/99/12/08/0752248.shtml">attacked</a> like
centralized peer-to-peer systems such as <a href="http://www.napster.com/">Napster</a>.
Freenet also employs intelligent routing and caching meaning that it learns to
route requests more efficiently, automatically mirrors popular data, makes
network flooding almost impossible, and moves data to where it is in greatest
demand. All of this makes it much more efficient and scalable than systems such
as <a href="http://gnutella.wego.com/">Gnutella</a>.  Ian Clarke,Brandon

<h3>The Intermemory Initiative</h3>
<p align="left">&quot;A planetary memory for all mankind is coming...  The
initiative aims to develop highly survivable and available storage systems made
up of widely distributed processors that are individually unreliable and
untrustworthy -- with the overall system nevertheless secure. Inspired by the
Internet and Web, this project targets self-organization, self-maintenance, and
effective administration in the absence of central control. It is basic research
in the area of Internet distributed algorithms and protocols, and may lead
someday to a standard for information archives -- an important component of
digital libraries.&quot;  <a href="http://www.intermemory.org/">[www.intermemory.org/</a>

<h2>Cyber-Snooping</h2>
<p>There is now (June 2000) commercially available software that covertly
records every key an employee touches, and then tells the boss.   In
fact, if you try to delete the keys out and back space over them, the software
has a facility to unwork that...so you cannot delete what you were typing and
get away with it.</p>
