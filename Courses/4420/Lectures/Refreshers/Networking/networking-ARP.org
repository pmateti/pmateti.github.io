* Overview

ARP is the protocol for given the IP address, we wish to find the MAC
address.  Why do we need this? Because of IP routing.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to translate IP addresses to
Ethernet addresses (also called MAC address, or hardware address in
this context).  You can see this address in the (pruned) output of =%
ifconfig=, following the word "ether"

#+begin_src bash
enp5s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.17.240  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.17.255
        inet6 fe80::af8c:6184:b03d:ad1d  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether bc:5f:f4:5b:78:bf  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 2190923  bytes 2094276405 (2.0 GB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 2214540  bytes 1605787527 (1.6 GB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

** Routing

During normal operation, a network application sends an application
message to TCP, then TCP sends the corresponding TCP message to the IP
module.  The destination IP address is known by the application, the
TCP module, and the IP module.

At this point the IP packet has been constructed and is ready to be
sent out via the NIC (network interface card), typically Ethernet.
The OS LAN layer must construct an Ethernet packet with source and
destination (next hop) addresses and the IP packet as the payload.

The ARP table (cache) is used to look-up the destination Ethernet
address.

* ARP Cache

To request the IP-to-MAC address translation through ARP is time
consuming if we do it every time.  So, the OS maintains for a separate
ARP table (called the ARP cache) for each of its Ethernet interfaces.

Here is an example output (of the ARP cache) from =% arp= (pruned).

#+begin_src bash
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress        
Chromecast               ether   d0:e7:82:7b:3a:61
pmatetiDoogee            ether   00:1d:54:42:3a:4b
sunshine                 ether   00:30:67:b1:f0:09
pmatetiN8013             ether   60:21:c0:65:67:da
unknown00A0964EED98      ether   00:a0:96:4e:ed:98
homeportal               ether   98:2c:be:cf:35:b1

                      TABLE 1.  Example ARP Cache Table
#+end_src


If the ARP cache table does not have an entry for an IP address,
the outgoing IP packet is queued, and

1. an ARP request packet is broadcast that says "If your IP address
   matches this target IP address, then please tell me your Ethernet
   address".

1. We expect one host on the LAN to reply.
1. This ARP response packet has the sender / target field contents
   swapped as compared to the request.

The IP-to-MAC address translation is performed with the above cache
table look-up.  The queued IP packet can now be sent.  The IP-to-MAC
address translation is done only for outgoing IP packets, because this
is when the IP header and the Ethernet header are created.

The entries in the ARP Caches have a time limit after which the
entries are flushed out.  Why? Because IP address assignment changes
often (minutes or seconds).  

Try: =ping www.google.com= every few minutes.


* ARP Cache Poisoning

1. Suppose we (machine MC) sent out a query for the IP address IPA.
1. This address IPA belongs to machine MA.  Further suppose, MA was
   down.
1. All other machines on the LAN also received this broadcast.
1. But, if machine MB replies with its MAC address, saying IPA is its
   IP address.  (Why would it?)
1. The OS on machine MC now has an entry in its cache mapping IPA to
   MB instead of MA.
1. This is known as ARP Cache Poisoning.

** Commentary

1. Why was MA down?  (May be MB attacked it and caused it to crash.)
1. Why did MB reply?  (Malicious)
1. ARP naively trusts the responses it gets.  

* ARP Cache Poisoning Defense

1. Crwowd sourcing.  Ask your neighbor if "he" also has the same row
   in his cache.

1. Learn and run =arpd=.  Read =man arpd=

* RARP (Reverse-ARP)


RARP is the protocol for given the MAC address, we wish to find the IP
address.
