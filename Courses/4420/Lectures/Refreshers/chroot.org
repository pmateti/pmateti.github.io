* Background

1. Prerequisite: Libcalls v syscalls.

1. Read through =man syscalls= and =man chroot= + =man 2 chroot=

* Usage/ Semantics of =chroot=

1. The word root here is about the root of a directory hierarchy, not
   the super-user.

1. Before entering the chroot a number of directories need to be
   mounted.  Some basic configuration files will need to be copied
   from the host.

: # mount -t proc /proc /mnt/mychroot/proc
: # mount --rbind /dev /mnt/mychroot/dev
: # mount --rbind /sys /mnt/mychroot/sys
: # mount --rbind /tmp /mnt/mychroot/tmp
: # cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/mychroot/etc

Then, invoke =# chroot /mnt/mychroot /bin/bash=

** Full Path Names

1. Full path names begin with the =/= (the slash).
1. Consider the file/dir hierarchy preferably with multiple mounts.
1. =chroot= can re-locate the root directory of a full path name to any
   directory on this hierarchy.
1. Consider a process with PID 12345.  Examine =/proc/12345/root= This
   will be a symbolic link to the "root" dir of this process.

** Goal: Chroot Jail

1. Having chroot-ed, =/../= becomes illegal.  This brought us the term
   "chroot jail".  "First Gen Sandbox"

** Man Pages?!

1. Man pages do their best, but are not always unambiguous or
   definitive.

1. =man chroot= has the following at the top: "chroot - run command or
   interactive shell with special root directory".

   1. This is way too ambiguous.

** Root Only?

1. The chroot system call is only available to the root user. A
   non-root user cannot execute a chroot() call.

1. Any process having done a =chroot= ought to drop its privileges to
   run as =nobody= or an otherwise unknown user.
