* Abstract

A large number of exploits have been due to sloppy software
development. Exceeding array bounds is referred to in security circles
as "buffer overflow." These are by far the most common security
problems in software. This lecture explains the stack-smashing
technique, and presents a few techniques that help in avoiding the
exploit.

1. I often give 3 to 5 (55-minute) lectures on this topic.
1. At least one on AlephOne.
1. Lecture #1: Overview, Background, Ideas on: {Code Injection,
   Detection, Prevention}
1. Lecture #2: Aleph One article, full exploration
1. Lecture #3: Aleph One article, full exploration; past videos of mine
1. Lecture #4: Experience the Exploit
1. Lecture #5: Exploring recent CVEs on Buffer Overflow
1. Coupled Topic: Software Development without Security Holes

* Buffer Overflow Overview
1. End result: a super-user owned shell process is born
1. The enabling weaknesses
  1. data address space and executable code address space are not disjoint
  1. sloppy programming
1. Intricately depends on: PL, Compiler, OS, CPU
1. Arguably: The first security exploit (1988)
1. Arguably: The most common exploit
1. Arguably: The still prevalent exploit
1. Alt names: buffer overrun, stack smashing, code injection
1. Related exploits: heap overflow, format string exploit, ...
1. Famous Buffer Overflow Attacks: https://engineering.purdue.edu/ResearchGroups/SmashGuard/BoF.html
   

* Background Knowledge
1. Command line shells
   1. konsole + bash
   1. bash PS1 prompt
1. Details (semantics and compiled code) of C
   1. String library methods: =strcpy=, =strcat=
   1. Array bounds
   1. Effective address calculation

   1. Stack frame
   1. [[./C-intricacies.org]]
   1. [[../LinuxSetup/StudyPrograms/]]
1. OS Details
   1. System call: =execv=
   1. System call: =exit=
   1. setuserid =suid= root

* Code Injection Idea

1. The program is unmodified.
1. The running process is modified.
1. Modifying the return address (located on the stack)
1. Insert (effectively) new machine code sequence into the process
1. And return!

** Choosing a binary
1. Stack allocated local array
1. Unchecked array index usage
1. Copying a given argument into a local array
1. Supplying a carefully constructed string argument
1. The string has the executable machine code

** Shell code

1. Designing the shell-code to be injected
   1. [[../LinuxSetup/StudyPrograms/testsc.c]]
1. Constructing the shell-code from disassembly
1. Fine tuning the shell code as a proper string


** Modifying the return address

1. Studying [[./modret/modret.c]]
1. Modify the  return address to the beginning of the "string"
1. modReturnAddress-acer602-20080507.html These are the results of
   trying out the code examples from the AlephOne article. These notes
   were recorded with Auditor LiveCD on my old Acer laptop with
   Pentium III (Coppermine) running Debian GNU/Linux 3.1, gcc version
   3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-2).

* The Exploit

1. Putting it all together
1. Padding the Shell Code with NOPs so that jump target address is less critical
1. Inputting the shell code as an argument
1. [[./AlephOne/alephOne.html]] One of the best exaplanation of Stack Smashing.

* Experiencing the Exploit in the Lab

1. As of 2019, many "standard" code injections have been prevented.
1. Virtual Machines
   1. VirtualBox
   1. VMware
1. Linux Distro: (BackTrack) Audtor.ISO 
   1. An Old OS/C-compiler/bash
   1. Uses IDE drives; so not bootable on modern PCs

** Disable Stack top randomization

1. Compile any program (e.g. from StudyPrograms).
1. Invoke it several times, and print the address of a local variable
   of =main= Is it changing?  That is Stack Top Randomization.

** Disabling Stack Protection

1. Compiler flags: no canaries =gcc overflow.c -o overflow
   -fno-stack-protector=
1. [[./bo.c]] compile: =gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o bo bo.c=


** Disable ASLR

1. ASLR Address Space Layout Randomization
1. Disable ASLR: =sudo echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space=
   Enabled: =randomize_va_space= should be 2

1. ASLR is effective only if the binary was PIE (position independent
   code enabled). =-fPIC -pie=

* Detection

1. Checking the caller of =execv=
1. Deep packet inspection
1. Tools: Chaperon, Valgrind, CCured, CRED, Insure++, ProPolice and TinyCC, ...

* Prevention
1. CPU/MMU: Separate address spaces for Data and  Machine Instructions
      1. noexec-user-stack
      1. Never-eXecute (NX) bit  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit
      1. Intel: XD bit, eXecute Disable
      1. AMD: Enhanced Virus Protection
      1. ARM: XN for eXecute Never
1. Stack top  randomization
1. ASLR Address space layout randomization
1. Run-time Check for Input Taintedness
1. Run-time Check for  Array Bounds

** Secure Programming Practices 

1. Techniques of Avoiding Buffer Overflow
1. Safe String Libraries
1. Static Analysis of Source Code
1. Lectures on [[../SecSoftware/]]

* Labs

1. [[./Labs/bufovf-lab.org][Lab on Buffer Overflow Exploits]]

* Reading List

1. Readings are grouped into Required and Recommended.
1. Required Readings are a must read.  These are sources of exam
   questions.
1. Recommended Readings bring more insight into the topic.  But exam
   questions will not be derived from these.
1. Some of our "readings" are actually web site visits.
