exploit3.c: (in function get_sp)
exploit3.c:16:2: Path with no return in function declared to return unsigned
                    long int
  There is a path through a function declared to return a value on which there
  is no return statement. This means the execution may fall through without
  returning a meaningful result to the caller. (Use -noret to inhibit warning)
exploit3.c:18:6: Function main declared to return void, should return int
  The function main does not match the expected type. (Use -maintype to inhibit
  warning)
exploit3.c: (in function main)
exploit3.c:27:23: Function malloc expects arg 1 to be size_t gets int: bsize
  To allow arbitrary integral types to match any integral type, use
  +matchanyintegral.
exploit3.c:32:3: Assignment of unsigned long int to long int:
                    addr = get_sp() - offset
  To ignore signs in type comparisons use +ignoresigns
exploit3.c:33:35: Format argument 1 to printf (%x) expects unsigned int gets
                     long int: addr
   exploit3.c:33:29: Corresponding format code
exploit3.c:41:5: Assignment of int to char: buff[i] = 0x90
  To make char and int types equivalent, use +charint.
exploit3.c:44:15: Operands of < have incompatible types (int, size_t):
                     i < strlen(shellcode)
exploit3.c:50:3: Unrecognized identifier: putenv
  Identifier used in code has not been declared. (Use -unrecog to inhibit
  warning)
exploit3.c:51:3: Return value (type int) ignored: system("/bin/bash")
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalint to inhibit warning)
exploit3.c:52:2: Last reference buff to owned storage ptr not released before
                    return
  A memory leak has been detected. Only-qualified storage is not released
  before the last reference to it is lost. (Use -mustfreeonly to inhibit
  warning)
   exploit3.c:43:3: Original reference lost
exploit3.c:9:6: Variable exported but not used outside exploit3: shellcode
  A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can
  use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
exploit3.c:14:15: Function exported but not used outside exploit3: get_sp
   exploit3.c:16:1: Definition of get_sp
