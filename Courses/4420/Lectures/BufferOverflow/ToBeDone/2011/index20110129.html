<h1>Buffer Overflow</h1>
<p>Buffer overflow is a common programming error.&nbsp; There is not a single OS 
that is free from this error.&nbsp; Buffer overflows have been causing serious 
security problems for decades. In the most famous example, the Internet worm of 
1988 used a buffer overflow in <code>fingerd</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is surprising is that a number of security 
oriented software such as SSH and Kerberos also have these errors.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Buffer Overflow Error</h2>
<p>The essence of this problem can be explained by the following.&nbsp; The line
<code>strcpy(p, q)</code> is a common piece of code in most systems&nbsp; 
programs.&nbsp; An example of this is: <code>char env[32]; strcpy(env, 
getenv(&quot;TERM&quot;)); </code>The <code>strcpy(p, q)</code> is proper only when</p>
<ol>
  <li>p is pointing to a char array of size m,</li>
  <li>q is pointing to a char array of size n,</li>
  <li>m &gt;= n,</li>
  <li>q[i] == '\0' for some i where <code>0 &lt;= i &lt;= n-1</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, only a few programs verify that all the above hold prior to 
invoking <code>strcpy(p, q)</code>.&nbsp; A buffer overflow occurs when an 
object of size <code>m + d </code>is placed into a container of size <code>m</code>. 
This can happen in many situations when the programmer does not take proper care 
to bounds check what their functions do and what they are placing into variables 
inside their programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If <code>n&nbsp; &gt; m </code>in the <code>
strcpy(p, q)</code> of above an area of memory beyond <code>&amp;p[m] </code>gets 
overwritten.</p>
<p>A few other examples of such buffer overflows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>char input[20]; gets(input);</code></li>
  <li>memcpy(p, q);</li>
</ul>
<h2>Buffer Overflow Exploits</h2>
<p>An attacker exploits this programming mistake.&nbsp; He injects cleverly 
constructed data / executable-code into the area beyond the declared sizes.&nbsp; 
If the &quot;buffer&quot; is a local C variable, the overflow can be used to force the 
function to run code of an attackers' choosing. This specific variation is often 
called a ``stack smashing'' attack. A buffer in the heap isn't much better.&nbsp; 
Attackers have been able to use such overflows to control other variables in the 
program.</p>
<h3>Stack Smashing</h3>
<p>Stack-smashing attacks target a specific programming fault: careless use of 
variables allocated on the program's run-time stack such as local variables and 
function arguments.&nbsp; The idea is straightforward: Insert attack code (for 
example, code that invokes a shell) somewhere and overwrite the stack in such a 
way that control gets passed to the attack code.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the program 
being exploited runs with root privilege, the attacker gets that privilege in 
the interactive session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paper by Aleph One, &quot;Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit,&quot;&nbsp; 
describes the technique in great detail, and is required reading.&nbsp;But it 
has a few inaccuracies.&nbsp; A version of this 
  paper with a few of my corrections in place is <a href="alephOne.html">here</a>. 
A few additional comments are included below.</p>
<p>Buffer overflow code intimately depends on (i) the CPU, (ii) the OS and (iii) 
the compiler of the language that the code is in. Aleph One's is paper is 
written in 1990s, and the examples are based on a Linux version running on an 
x86 32-bit machine.&nbsp; If you are trying his code, on a machine today, you 
need to adjust it.&nbsp; Most Linux installations now use libraries that can 
detect stack smashing.</p>
<h3>Heap overflows versus stack overflows</h3>
<p>&quot;Heap overflows are generally much harder to exploit than stack overflows 
(although successful heap overflow attacks do exist). For this reason, some 
programmers never statically allocate buffers. Instead, they malloc() or new 
everything, and believe this will protect them from overflow problems. Often 
they are right, because there aren't many people who have the expertise required 
to exploit heap overflows. But dynamic buffer allocation is not intrinsically 
less dangerous than other approaches. Don't rely on dynamic allocation for 
everything and forget about the buffer overflow problem. Dynamic allocation is 
not a cure-all.&quot;</p>
<p>For more details on heap overflows, read the article &quot;w00w00 on Heap 
Overflows&quot; cited in the references.</p>
<h2>Techniques of Avoiding Buffer Overflow</h2>
<h3>Modern Programming Languages</h3>
<p>Most modern programming languages are essentially immune to this problem, 
either because they automatically resize arrays (e.g., Perl, and Java), or 
because they normally detect and prevent buffer overflows (e.g., Ada95 and 
Java). However, the C language provides no protection against such problems, and 
C++ can be easily used in ways to cause this problem too.</p>
<h3>Careful Use of C/C++ Library Functions</h3>
<p>C users must avoid using functions that do not check bounds unless they've 
ensured the bounds will never get exceeded. Functions to avoid in most cases 
include: <code>strcpy(3), strcat(3), sprintf(3), and gets(3)</code>. These 
should be replaced with functions such as <code>strncpy(3), strncat(3), 
snprintf(3), and fgets(3)</code> respectively, but see the discussion below. The 
function <code>strlen(3) </code>should be avoided unless you can guarantee that 
there will be a terminating NUL (ascii code zero) character to find. Other 
functions that may permit buffer overruns include<code> fscanf(3), scanf(3), 
vsprintf(3), realpath(3), getopt(3), getpass(3), streadd(3), strecpy(3), </code>
and<code> strtrns(3)</code>.</p>
<p>Beware that calls to <code>strncpy(3) </code>and<code> strncat(3)</code> have 
somewhat surprising semantics and are hard to use correctly. E.g., the function 
strncpy(3) does not NUL-terminate the destination string if the source string 
length is at least equal to the destination's, so be sure to set the last 
character of the destination string to NUL after calling <code>strncpy(3)</code>. 
If you're going to reuse the same buffer many times, an efficient approach is to 
tell <code>strncpy()</code> that the buffer is one character shorter than it 
actually is and set the last character to NUL once before use. Both <code>
strncpy(3) </code>and<code> strncat(3)</code> require that you pass the amount 
of space available. Neither provide a simple mechanism to determine <i>if</i> an 
overflow has occurred. Finally, <code>strncpy(3)</code> has a significant 
performance penalty compared to the <code>strcpy(3),</code> because <code>
strncpy(3)</code> NUL-fills the remainder of the destination. </p>
<h3>Static and Dynamically Allocated Buffers</h3>
<p>The fact that a buffer is a fixed length may be exploitable. The basic idea 
is that the attacker sets up a really long string so that, when the string is 
truncated, the final result will be what the attacker wanted (instead of what 
the developer intended). Perhaps the string is catenated from several smaller 
pieces; the attacker might make the first piece as long as the entire buffer, so 
all later attempts to concatenate strings do nothing. Here are some specific 
examples: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
	<p align="justify">Imagine code that calls <code>gethostbyname(3)</code> and, if successful, 
  immediately copies <code>hostent-&gt;h_name </code>to a fixed-size buffer using 
  strncpy or snprintf. Using strncpy or snprintf protects against an overflow of 
  an excessively long fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), so you might think 
  you're done. However, this could result in chopping off the end of the FQDN. 
  This may be very undesirable, depending on what happens next. </li>
  <li>
	<p align="justify">Imagine code that uses <code>strncpy, strncat, snprintf,</code> etc., to 
  copy the full path of a filesystem object to some buffer. Further imagine that 
  the original value was provided by an untrusted user, and that the copying is 
  part of a process to pass a resulting computation to a function. Now imagine 
  that an attacker pads a path with a large number of '/'s at the beginning. 
  This could result in future operations being performed on the file ``/''. If 
  the program appends values in the belief that the result will be safe, the 
  program may be exploitable. Or, the attacker could devise a long filename near 
  the buffer length, so that attempts to append to the filename would silently 
  fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative is to dynamically reallocate all strings instead of using 
fixed-size buffers. This general approach is recommended by the GNU programming 
guidelines, since it permits programs to handle arbitrarily-sized inputs (until 
they run out of memory). The memory may even be exhausted at some other point in 
the program than the portion where you're worried about buffer overflows; any 
memory allocation can fail. Also, since dynamic reallocation may cause memory to 
be inefficiently allocated, it is entirely possible to run out of memory even 
though technically there is enough virtual memory available to the program to 
continue. In addition, before running out of memory the program will probably 
use a great deal of virtual memory; this can easily result in ``thrashing'', a 
situation in which the computer spends all its time just shuttling information 
between the disk and memory (instead of doing useful work). This can have the 
effect of a denial of service attack. Some rational limits on input size can 
help here. In general, the program must be designed to be fail safe when memory 
is exhausted. </p>
<h3>Newer Libraries</h3>
<p>Newer libraries for C include the <code>strlcpy(3) </code>and<code> 
strlcat(3)</code> functions, with prototypes: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>size_t strlcpy (char *dst, const char *src, size_t size);
size_t strlcat (char *dst, const char *src, size_t size);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Both <code>strlcpy</code> and <code>strlcat</code> take the full size of the 
destination buffer as a parameter (not the maximum number of characters to be 
copied) and guarantee to NUL-terminate the result (as long as size is larger 
than 0). The <code>strlcpy</code> function copies up to <code>size-1</code> 
characters from the NUL-terminated string <code>src</code> to <code>dst</code>, 
NUL-terminating the result. The <code>strlcat</code> function appends the NUL-terminated 
string <code>src</code> to the end of <code>dst</code>. It will append at most
<code>size - strlen(dst) - 1</code> bytes, NUL-terminating the result. </p>
<p>One nuisance is that these two functions are not, by default, installed in 
most Unix-like systems. </p>
<h3>Compilation Solutions in C/C++</h3>
<p>Newer compilers perform bounds-checking. Visit, e.g.,
<a href="http://www-ala.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/BoundsChecking.html">http://www-ala.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/BoundsChecking. html</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; Such tools provide one more 
layer of defense, but it's not wise to depend on this technique as your sole 
defense. There are at least two reasons for this. First, most such tools only 
provide partial defense against buffer overflows (and the ``complete'' defenses 
are generally 10-30 times slower); C and C++ were simply not designed to protect 
against buffer overflow. Second, for open source programs you cannot be certain 
what tools will be used to compile the program; using the default ``normal'' 
compiler for a given system might suddenly open security flaws. </p>
<p>StackGuard [Cowan et al. 1998] is a modification of the standard GNU C 
compiler gcc. StackGuard works by inserting a ``guard'' value (called a 
``canary'', as in how this bird was used in mines) in front of the return 
address; if a buffer overflow overwrites the return address, the canary's value 
(hopefully) changes and the system detects this before using it. This is quite 
valuable, but note that this does not protect against buffer overflows 
overwriting other values (which they may still be able to use to attack a 
system). </p>
<h3>Non-executable user stack area</h3>
<p>It is possible to modify the Linux kernel so that the stack segment is not 
executable (see grsecurity). However, this is not built into the standard Linux 
2.4 kernels. In Linux 2.6.x kernels, you must chose grsecurity configuration 
options. Part of the rationale is that this is less protection than it appears; 
attackers can simply force the system to call other ``interesting'' locations 
already in the program (e.g., in its library, the heap, or static data 
segments). Also, sometimes Linux does require executable code in the stack, 
e.g., to implement signals and to implement GCC ``trampolines''. </p>
<p>Even in the presence of non-executable stack, Linux Torvalds explains that 
&quot;It's _really_ easy. You do something like this: 1) overflow the buffer on the 
stack, so that the return value is overwritten by a pointer to the <code>
system()</code> library function. 2) the next four bytes are crap (a &quot;return 
pointer&quot; for the system call, which you don't care about) 3) the next four bytes 
are a pointer to some random place in the shared library again that contains the 
string <code>&quot;/bin/sh&quot;</code> (and yes, just do a <code>strings</code> on the 
thing and you'll find it). Voila. You didn't have to write any code, the _only_ 
thing you needed to know was where the library is loaded by default. And yes, 
it's library-specific, but hey, you just select one specific commonly used 
version to crash. Suddenly you have a root shell on the system. So it's not only 
doable, it's fairly trivial to do. In short, anybody who thinks that the 
non-executable stack gives them any real security is very very much living in a 
dream world. It may catch a few attacks for old binaries that have security 
problems, but the basic problem is that the binaries allow you to overwrite 
their stacks. And if they allow that, then they allow the above exploit. It 
probably takes all of five lines of changes to some existing exploit, and some 
random program to find out where in the address space the shared libraries tend 
to be loaded.&quot;</p>
<p>In short, it's better to work first on developing a correct program that 
defends itself against buffer overflows. Then, after you've done this, by all 
means use techniques and tools like StackGuard as an additional safety net. If 
you've worked hard to eliminate buffer overflows in the code itself, then 
StackGuard is likely to be more effective because there will be fewer ``chinks 
in the armor'' that StackGuard will be called on to protect. </p>
<h3>No set-user-id Programs</h3>
<p>An attacker targets set user id programs so that after the exploit he is the 
root, and can do arbitrary things.&nbsp; So, some &quot;people believe that if their 
program is not running suid root, they don't have to worry about security 
problems in their code, since the program can't be leveraged to achieve greater 
access levels. That idea has some merit, but is still a risky proposition. For 
one thing, you never know who is going to take your program and set the suid bit 
on the binary. When people can't get something to work properly, they get 
desperate. We've seen this sort of situation lead to entire directories of 
programs needlessly set setuid root.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There can also be users of your software with no privileges at all. That 
means any successful buffer overflow attack will give them more privileges than 
they previously had. Usually, such attacks involve the network. For example, a 
buffer overflow in a network server program that can be tickled by outside users 
may provide an attacker with a login on the machine. The resulting session has 
the privileges of the process running the compromised network service. This type 
of attack happens all the time. Often, such services run as root (and generally 
for no good reason other than to make use of a privileged low port). Even when 
such services don't run as root, as soon as a cracker gets an interactive shell 
on a machine, it is usually only a matter of time before the machine is &quot;owned&quot; 
-- that is, the attacker gains complete control over the machine, such as root 
access on a UNIX box or administrator access on a Windows NT box. Such control 
is typically garnered by running a different exploit through the interactive 
shell to escalate privileges.&quot; [Quoted from
