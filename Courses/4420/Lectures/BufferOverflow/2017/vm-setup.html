    <h1>Virtual Machines</h1>

    <p>&quot;A virtual machine (VM) is a software implementation of a
      machine (i.e. a computer) that executes programs like a physical
      machine. Virtual machines are separated into two major
      categories, based on their use and degree of correspondence to
      any real machine. A <b>system virtual machine</b> provides a
      complete system platform</a> which supports the execution of a
complete operating system</a> (OS). In contrast, a <b>process
  virtual machine</b> is designed to run a single program</a>,
which means that it supports a single process</a>. An essential
characteristic of a virtual machine is that the software running
inside is limited to the resources and abstractions provided by
the virtual machine—it cannot break out of its virtual
world.&quot; -- from [1].</p>

<p>In general, virtual machines (VMs) are designed so that an
  entire computer system (hardware + software) is mimicked inside
  (however, Java Virtual Machine [JVM] is a case where it is
  &quot;just the CPU-equivalent&quot; without an actual operating
  system). The end effect is that we are able to run multiple
  systems &quot;simultaneously&quot; within another host
  system.  For example, we can install a virtual machine on CentOS
  5.5 and, within the VM on CentOS, run Windows XP, Windows Vista
  (if you have a desire to use that OS for some odd reason), OS-X,
  and Kubuntu 12.10. However, for this lab, we won't be doing
  anything nearly so complex. For the rest of this article, I will
  use 'host OS' to refer to the original operating system
  installed on a particular machine, and 'guest OS' to refer to an
  operating running within a virtual machine.</p>

<p>The operating systems running within the VM share the resources
  of the host system. Therefore, CPU and RAM are not
  dedicated. The partitions for the guest OS are actually virtual
  partitions created on a hard drive of the physical machine. For
  instance, the host OS may mount /dev/sda1 as the root drive
  (Remember, the 'a' refers to the first physical drive found, and
  the '1' refers to the first partition on that drive). The guest
  OS might see a 20GB drive available and mount it as its root,
  but that drive is only a portion of the real hard drive within
  an actual partition (such as /dev/sda1).</p>


<h1><a name="OSIS_Lab_Files">OSIS Lab</a></h1>

<ol>

  <li>There are several virtual machine programs (see [1]).  Two
    that are free (may not be GPL3 open source), but are considered
    the best among the breed are:
    <ol>
      <li>Virtual Box <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">
	  http://www.virtualbox.org</a></li>
      <li>VMware <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">
	  http://www.vmware.com/</a> </li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the OSIS Lab "Ubuntu For All Classes" system, we
      already installed the VirtualBox and vmware.  Knoppix and BT5
      may also have these installed.  If not, download and install the
      free VirtualBox from <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">
      http://www.virtualbox.org/</a>.  Download the free VMware Player
      from <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">
      http://www.vmware.com/</a> for our platform (Linux
      64-bit). </p></li>

  <li>In the OSIS Lab, the NFS file server 192.168.17.111 exports
    the volume <code>/var/ISO</code> that has the following files
    relevant to this article:
    <tt>
      auditor-250405-01.iso, VMware-player-*.exe,
      VMware-Player-*.x86_64.bundle</tt>

    <p>They can be used as NFS-mounted files.  For better performance,
      copy the needed files to a local hard drive or USB drive.

    <p>The .bundle is a
      shell "script" for Linux 64-bit systems; install it as in
      <tt>/bin/sh VMware-Player-*.x86_64.bundle</tt></li>

  <li>In the OSIS Lab, the <tt>auditor-250405-01.iso</tt> has been
    copied to the local file volume on partition /dev/sda5 [check].
    You can mount it in Knoppix or BackTrack as follows:
    <pre>
      mkdir -p /tmp/5
      mount -o ro /dev/sda5 /tmp/5</pre>
    <p>In VMplayer or VirtualBox, give the iso path name
      as <tt>/tmp/5/boot/OSISO/auditor-250405-01.iso</tt>      </li>

  <li>USB drives can be mounted within the guest OS (e.g.,
    Auditor), but may have to be manually mounted.</li>

  <li>If you wish network setup in the guest OS, you can
    use <code>dhclient eth0</code></li>
</ol>

<h1>Auditor Live CD</h1>

<p> Auditor distribution is by the same group that now releases
  BackTrack.  Auditor predates the many buffer overflow prevention
  techniques that are now standard in current Linux distros.  Note in
  particular that Auditor does not support SATA HDDs -- only supports
  IDE drives.</p>

<p>If you have an old PC that has IDE hard drives, you will get a much
  faster Auditor by running the Auditor Live direct (without any VM).
</p>

<p>Within Auditor, expect the results of
  <a href="./modReturnAddress-acer602-20080507.html">
    modReturnAddress-acer602-20080507</a> to hold.  If you notice
    discrepancies, please report.</p>

<h1>Virtual Box</h1>

  <ol>

    <li>
      Under the menu 'Machine', select &quot;New...&quot;. This starts a
      wizard that sets up the hardware.  Of course, this hardware is
      virtual, may or may not be physically present.  Create a name for
      your VM.  Since we are running Auditor, we want the OS to be 'Linux'
      and the Version to be 'Other Linux'.</li>

    <li>Set the size of RAM allocated to this machine to 512 MB.  That is
      more than enough for our purposes in this lab.  If we were
      setting up a virtual machine to play computer games or for high-end
      processing, this should be significantly increased.</li>

    <li>Create a new hard disk (say 100 MB).  There are two ways the
      VM can treat this drive. The first is fixed-sized where a file
      of the size chosen is created immediately and this size never
      changes. The other way is a hard drive with a dynamic size, that
      grows, as needed, up to the size you originally specified.
      Fixed-size is faster, dynamic size is flexible.  Complete both
      the 'virtual disk wizard' and the 'VM setup wizard'.</li>

    <li>
      VB knows that no OS is installed yet, and will ask for that
      info via the 'First Run Wizard'.  Choose a "virtual CD/DVD
      disk file", and naviagate to 
      <tt>/tmp/5/boot/OSISO/auditor-250405-01.iso</tt> The VM will
      then proceed to boot from the "disk".  A screen resolution of
      800x600 is sufficient.  The boot may take several minutes and
      you will receive several pop-up messages warning about the
      color depth and mouse support - just ignore those. Initially,
      you will only have a console, but Auditor will soon launch X11
      and present you with a GUI window.</li>

    <li> At this point, you have a fully-running version of Auditor
      inside your host OS.  Before turning off the virtual machine,
      shut down or power off within Auditor's menu.  To end the VB,
      select 'Close...' from the 'Machine' menu. VB will then ask
      you what you want to do; select 'Power off the machine'. This
      will safely turn off the guest OS, not the host machine.</li>

    <li>If the mouse is captured by the guest OS, release it by
    pressing the Right-Ctrl key.</li>
  </ol>


  <h1>VMware Player</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Download VMware Player free version from vmware.com.
    <li>Virtual machine setup details via the GUI Menu are similar to
      those above.  Easier perhaps is: <tt>vmplayer AuditorVM.vmx
        &amp; </tt> (The AuditorVM.vmx file content is shown below.)
      This will load the iso named in the .vmx file into the VMPlayer
      and you will be prompted with Auditor's boot sequence. Select
      video resolution (800x600).  Relax and wait: It can take about 3
      minutes for the entire iso to load up until the root# prompt is
      shown. Wait another minute or so for the X11 GUI to load up,
      when this finishes you are ready to do the buffer overflow
      lab.
    <li>When finished go into the Auditor VM and logoff  &gt;
      shutdown, wait until the 'remove cd' prompt appears, hit enter
      and the VMPlayer will close successfully.</li>
    <li>To release mouse/ keyboard control of the VMPlayer,
      press Ctrl + Alt. </li>
  </ol>

<h3>USB Setup</h3>

<p>
"Failed to access the USB subsystem."  VirtualBox access to USB
devices can be enabled by adding user to the 'vboxusers' group.  The
user manual has a more detailed explanation.  Install the Oracle VM
VirtualBox Extension Pack.
