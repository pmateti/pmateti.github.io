Failed to access the USB subsystem.
VirtualBox is not currently allowed to access USB devices. You can change this by adding your user to the 'vboxusers' group. Please see the user manual for a more detailed explanation.

On the USB page, USB 2.0 is currently enabled for this virtual machine. However, this requires the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack to be installed. Please install the Extension Pack from the VirtualBox download site. After this you will be able to re-enable USB 2.0. It will be disabled in the meantime unless you cancel the current settings changes.
