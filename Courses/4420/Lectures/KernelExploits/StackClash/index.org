* Overview

1. This page has brief technical descriptions of a few kernel
   vulnerabilities.  Discovered in 2017 and 2018.  Network related
   items are skipped.  Not exhaustive.

1. Objective: Become familiar with CVE, and the description structure
   of a CVE.

1. Objective: Have a decent technical understanding of the
   vulnerability and the exploit.

1. Objective: Be able to apply a patch and rebuild and deploy the new
   kernel.  A patch to mitigate/ fix the vulnerability is provided by
   experts.

* Stack Clash

A vulnerability in the memory management of OS was discovered in 2017,
and named Stack Clash.  It can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
Qualys [ref] provided a technically detailed description.

CVE-2017-1000364

* Spectre

* #3 CVE-2017-15126

fs/userfaultfd.c
Vulnerability score: High — 8.1
Versions: before 4.13.6.
The security issue in this kernel vulnerability is local memory corruption. More specifically, this is a use-after-free vulnerability, a specific type of memory corruption bug that can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or even enable full remote code execution.

In this case, the flaw was discovered in fs/userfaultfd.c in Linux kernel versions preceding 4.13.6, and is related to the handling of fork failure when dealing with event messages. This issue could be exploited by hackers to execute arbitrary code in context of the kernel. Failed exploit attempts can result in a DoS

The vulnerability and its fix have been published on a number of security advisories and bug trackers, and as usual, we’re here to let you know where you can find them. For more information about remediation you can check here, here and here.

* CVE-2017-1000253

 - load_elf_binary does not allocate sufficient space

Provided that an application is built as Position Independent
Executable (PIE), the loader can allow part of that application's data
segment to map over the memory area reserved for its stack resulting
in corruption of the stack, with possible privilege escalation. The
vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2017-1000253. This issue was
publicly disclosed on Tuesday September 26th, 2017 and is rated as
Important.
