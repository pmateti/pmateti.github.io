* Overview

1. "A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory
   subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private
   read-only memory mappings.  An unprivileged local user could use
   this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory
   mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system."


* References

   The bug has existed since around 2.6.22 (released in 2007) and was
   fixed on Oct 18, 2016.
