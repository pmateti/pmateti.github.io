1. Linux PIE/stack corruption (CVE-2017-1000253) A Local Privilege
   Escalation.
   https://www.qualys.com/2017/09/26/linux-pie-cve-2017-1000253/cve-2017-1000253.txt
   "An unprivileged local user with access to SUID (or otherwise
   privileged) PIE binary could use this flaw to escalate their
   privileges on the system."


* BackDoors

1. Backdoors is frequently an application issue.  But, there have been
   kernel backdoors.   [[./BackDoors/]]

* SymLinkAttack

1. "Symlink attack is one of the newest and easiest way of
   exploitation as the attacker gets full root access to the entire
   server from a compromised website.

* Viruses, Worms, Trojans

1. Defs: Viruses, Worms, Trojans TBD link

1. Linux malware includes viruses, trojans, worms.  At the level of
   academic, these are different.  But, virus is now a term that
   combines all these and has become slag-equivalent to malware.

1. Malware often  arrives via networking.  But, it can also arrive via
   files being opened/ copied, and USBD insertions.

1. Example: https://threats.kaspersky.com/ru/threat/Virus.Linux.Alaeda/ 2003? "Alaeda
   is a non-resident virus. It infects systems running Linux, and is
   written in Assembly. It infects .ELF format files in the current
   directory.  When infecting, the virus modifies the entry point of
   the original file, passing control to the infection routine. It
   then modifies the file's .ELF header. Before infecting, the virus
   checks to see if the computer is vulnerable. The .TXT part of the
   file must also be the minimum size to infect.  The virus writes its
   body to the .TXT section. The size of the file will not change,
   making it hard to tell if files are infected.  Once the virus body
   has delivered its payload, control is returned to the program
   code. If a file is already infected, the virus will not re-infect
   the file."
