<p>
"Unix. The world's first computer virus."
</p>

<p>
Title of Chapter 1 of The Unix Haters Handbook, ISBN: 1-56884-203-1
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The above book is in fact written by serious computer scientists.
Nevertheless, we must disregard the suggestion that Unix is a virus as
an attempt at being hilarious. Equally unhelpful are the news media that
use the term virus in referring to <i>any</i> piece of malicious software.
The academic world uses the term "malware" for these. The <i>purpose</i>, not
the approach, makes a program malicious. Many of the programs that fall
in the malware categories have benevolent uses. For example, worms can
be used to distribute computation on idle processors; back doors are
useful for debugging programs; and viruses can be written to update
source code and patch bugs. Rigorous definitions have been given by many
computer security experts but they do not match the typical use even by
other security experts. Thus, we must settle for "practical definitions"
of malicious software.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-viruses">

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Viruses</i> are executable code pieces that modify other programs on a
computer, inserting copies of themselves. A program is a file that
adheres to a strict description of how its content is organized. On
Linux systems, the ELF document of some 50-pages describes this
format. In this sense, viruses are not programs &#x2013; they cannot run on
their own, and need to become part of some host program. When such an
infected program is executed, the virus attaches itself to another and
so on. To evade detection, viruses are deliberately broken up and the
code is scatter-inserted into the host porgram. Computer science use
of the word is intended to mirror its use in biology.
</li>
<li><i>Bacteria</i>, or /rabbit programs,/ make copies of themselves to
overwhelm a computer system's resources. Bacteria do not explicitly
damage any files. Their sole purpose is to replicate themselves. A
typical bacteria program may do nothing more than execute two copies
of itself simultaneously on multiprogramming systems, or perhaps
create two new files, each of which is a copy of the original source
file of the bacteria program. Both of those programs then may copy
themselves twice, and so on. Bacteria reproduce exponentially,
eventually taking up all the processor capacity, memory, or disk
space, denying the user access to those resources.
</li>
<li>A <i>dropper</i> is a program that is not a virus, nor is it infected with
a virus, but when run it installs a virus into memory, on to the disk,
or into a file. Droppers have been written sometimes as a convenient
carrier for a virus, and sometimes as an act of sabotage. Some
anti-virus programs try to detect droppers.
</li>

<i>Blended threats</i> combine the characteristics of viruses, worms,
Trojan Horses, and malicious code with server and Internet
vulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread an attack. By using
multiple methods and techniques, blended threats can rapidly spread
and cause widespread damage. Characteristics of blended threats
include:<br  />
  \\
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Causes harm: Launches a Denial of Service (DoS) attack at a target
</li>
</ul>
<p>
IP address, defaces Web servers, or plants Trojan Horse programs for
later execution.<br  />
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Propagates by multiple methods: Scans for vulnerabilities to
</li>
</ul>
<p>
compromise a system, such as embedding code in HTML files on a server,
infecting visitors to a compromised Web site, or sending unauthorized
email from compromised servers with a worm attachment.<br  />
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Attacks from multiple points: Injects malicious code into the .exe
</li>
</ul>
<p>
files on a system, raises the privilege level of the guest account,
creates world read and writeable network shares, makes numerous
registry changes, and adds script code into HTML files.<br  />
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Spreads without human intervention: Continuously scans the Internet
</li>
</ul>
<p>
for vulnerable servers to attack.<br  />
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exploits vulnerabilities: Takes advantage of known vulnerabilities,
</li>
</ul>
<p>
such as buffer overflows, HTTP input validation vulnerabilities, and
known default passwords to gain unauthorized administrative access.<br  />
  \\
Effective protection from blended threats requires a comprehensive
security solution that contains multiple layers of defense and
response mechanisms.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-stealth-virus">

<p>
A <i>stealth</i> virus has code in it that seeks to conceal itself from
discovery or defends itself against attempts to analyze or remove it.
The stealth virus adds itself to a file or boot sector but, when you
examine, it appears normal and unchanged. The stealth virus performs
this trickery by staying in memory after it is executed. From there, it
monitors and intercepts your system calls. When the system seeks to open
an infected file, the stealth virus displays the uninfected version,
thus hiding itself.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-macro-viruses">

<p>
Macro languages are (often) equal in power to ordinary programming
languages such as C. A program written in a macro language is
interpreted by the application. Macro languages are conceptually no
different from so-called scripting languages. Gnu Emacs uses Lisp, most
Microsoft applications use Visual Basic Script as macro languages. The
typical use of a macro in applications, such as MS Word, is to extend
the features of the application. Some of these macros, known as
auto-execute macros, are executed in response to some event, such as
opening a file, closing a file, starting an application, and even
pressing a certain key. A macro virus is a piece of self-replicating
code inserted into an auto-execute macro. Once a macro is running, it
copies itself to other documents, delete files, etc. Another type of
hazardous macro is one named for an existing command of the application.
For example, if a macro named FileSave exists in the "normal.dot"
template of MS Word, that macro is executed whenever you choose the Save
command on the File menu. Unfortunately, there is often no way to
disable such features.
</p>

<p>
In May 2000, an OutLook mail program macro virus called LOVELETTER
propagated widely.

<p>
The most famous of the security incidents in the last decade was the
Internet Worm incident which began from a Unix system. But Unix systems
were considered virus-immune &#x2013; not so. Several Linux viruses have been
discovered. The Staog virus first appeared in 1996 and was written in
assembly language by the VLAD virus writing group, the same group
responsible for creating the first Windows 95 virus called Boza.
</p>

<p>
Like the Boza virus, the Staog virus is a proof-of-concept virus to
demonstrate the potential of Linux virus writing without actually
causing any real damage. Still, with the Staog assembly language source
code floating around the Internet, other virus writers are likely to
study and modify the code to create new strains of Linux viruses in the
future.
</p>

<p>
The second known Linux virus is called the Bliss virus. Unlike the Staog
virus, the Bliss virus can not only spread in the wild, but also
possesses a potentially dangerous payload that could wipe out data.
</p>

<p>
While neither virus is a serious threat to Linux systems, Linux and
other Unix systems will not remain virus-free. Fortunately, Linux virus
writing is more difficult than macro virus writing for Windows, so the
greatest virus threat still remains with Windows. [July 2000,

<p>
Whereas a Trojan horse is delivered pre-built, a virus infects. In the
past, such malicious programs arrived via tapes and disks, and the
spread of a virus around the world took many months. Antivirus companies
had time to identify a new viral strain, and create cleaning procedures.
Today, Trojan horses, and viruses are network deliverable as E-mail,
Java applets, ActiveX controls, JavaScripted pages, CGI-BIN scripts, or
as self-extracting packages.
</p>

<p>
Integrated mail systems such as Microsoft Outlook make it very simple to
send not only a quick note edited within a limited text editor but also
previously composed computer documents of arbitrary complexity to
anyone, and to work with objects that you receive via standards such as
MIME. They also support application programming interfaces (such as
MAPI) that allow programs to send and process mail automatically. Well
over 500 million E-mail messages are delivered daily in July 2000.
</p>

<p>
Mobile-program systems are becoming more and more widespread. The most
widely-hyped examples today are Java and ActiveX. This technology became
popular with Web servers and browsers, but it is now integrated (e.g.,
Java into Lotus Notes, and ActiveX into Outlook) mail systems. Both Java
and ActiveX have been found to have security bugs.

<h3 id="structure-of-viruses"><a id="sec-3-3" name="sec-3-3"></a><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Structure of Viruses</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-structure-of-viruses">

<p>
Here is a simple structure of a virus. In the infected binary, at a
known byte location in the file, a virus inserts a signature byte used
to determine if a potential carrier program has been previously
infected.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-C">V()
{
  infectExecutable();
  if (triggered()) {
    doDamage();
  }
  jump to main of infected program;
}

void infectExecutable()
{
 file = chose an uninfected executable file;
 prepend V to file;
}

void doDamage() {
   ...
}

int triggered()
{
  return (some test? 1 : 0);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The above virus makes the infected file longer than it was, making it
easy to spot. There are many techniques to leave the file length and
even a check sum unchanged and yet infect. For example, many executable
files often contain long sequences of zero bytes, which can be replaced
by the virus and re-generated. It is also possible to compress the
original executable code like the typical Zip programs do, and
uncompress before execution and pad with bytes so that the check sum
comes out to be what it was.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-virus-detection">

<p>
Known viruses are by far the most common security problem on modern
computer systems. Several web sites maintain complete lists of known
viruses. There are thousands. Visit, e.g.,
<a href="http://www.cai.com/virusinfo/encyclopedia/">www.cai.com/ virusinfo/
encyclopedia/</a>. In the month of July 2000, there were 200+ "PC Viruses
in the Wild" (<a href="http://www.wildlist.org/">www. wildlist. org</a>). Virus
detection programs analyze a suspect program for the presence of known
viruses.
</p>

<p>
Fred Cohen has proven mathematically that perfect detection of unknown
viruses is impossible: no program can look at other programs and say
either "a virus is present" or "no virus is present", and always be
correct. But, in the real world, most new viruses are sufficiently like
old viruses that the same sort of scanning that finds known viruses also
finds the new ones. And there are a large number of heuristic tricks
that anti-virus programs use to detect new viruses, based either on how
they look, or what they do. These heuristics are only sometimes
successful, but since brand-new viruses are comparatively rare, they are
sufficient to the purpose.
</p>

<p>
Virus scanners are sometimes classified by their "generation." The first
generation virus scanners used previously obtained a virus signature, a
bit pattern, to detect a known virus. They record and check the length
of all executables. The second generation scans executables with
heuristic rules, looking, e.g., for fragments of code associated with a
typical virus. They also do integrity checking by calculating a checksum
of a program and storing somewhere else the encrypted checksum. The
third generation use a memory resident program to monitor the execution
behavior of programs to identify a virus by the types of action that the
virus takes. The fourth Generation Virus Detection combines all previous
approaches and includes access control capabilities.
</p>

<p>
It is very educational to study the details of a scanner. The paper by
Sandeep Kumar, and Gene Spafford, "A Generic Virus Scanner in C++,"

<p>
A <i>worm</i> is a malicious program that copies itself from one computer to
another on a network. A worm is an independent program, in the sense
described above, unlike a virus which is a part-program that must insert
itself into a whole-program. A worm typically does not modify other
programs. A typical worm may carry other code, including programs and
viruses. We describe just two famous worms.

Trojans are programs that appear to have one function but actually
perform another function. Trojan horses are named after the Trojan horse
of the Greek Trojan War.

<li>Study the paper "An Undetectable Computer Virus", 2000, by David
M. Chess , Steve R. White. (Search for a link.)  Abstract:: One of
the few solid theoretical results in the study of computer viruses
is Cohen's 1987 demonstration that there is no algorithm that can
perfectly detect all possible viruses <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. This brief paper adds to
the bad news, by pointing out that there are computer viruses which
no algorithm can detect, even under a somewhat more liberal
definition of detection. We also comment on the senses of "detect"
used in these results, and note that the immediate impact of these
results on computer virus detection in the real world is small.
</li>

<li>Construct a virus as described.
</li>

<li>Which of the typical ant-virus scanners detect this?

These lecture materials are gleaned from many sources. All are presented
after careful reading. In some cases, I may have neglected proper
attribution. I assure the reader it is not because I claim authorship.
Indeed, in the lectures there is hardly any thing new that I have
contributed. Suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
