</blockquote>

Security and privacy on the Internet primarily rests on using
cryptography well.  The design and implementation of cryptography
requires deep understanding of mathematics.  Unfortunately, when
cryptography is deployed carelessly, it is easily compromised by
errors in (operating) system configuration.  This lecture is a quick
overview of cryptography as relevant in Internet security and
passwords.

<p>A cryptographic encryption algorithm, also known as <i>cipher</i>,
transforms a &quot;plain text&quot; (e.g., human
readable) <code>pt</code> and outputs cipher text
<code>ct</code> as the output, <pre>ct = cipher(pt, key)</pre> so that
it is possible to re-generate the <code>pt</code> from
the <code>ct</code> through a companion <i>decryption</i>
algorithm.&nbsp; Note that we said &quot;for example, human
readable&quot; and not &quot;that is, human readable&quot; as an
explanation for the phrase&nbsp; &quot;plain text&quot;.&nbsp; In
other words, the so-called &quot;plain text&quot; may be human
un-readable binary data that is ready-to-use by a computer.</p>
<p>Ciphers use <i>keys</i> together with plain text as the input to produce 
cipher text.&nbsp; It is in the key that the security of a modern cipher lies, 
not in the details of the algorithm.</p>

<h2>1. What does &quot;Computationally Infeasible&quot; mean?</h2>

<p>Roughly speaking, computationally infeasible means that a certain
computation that we are talking about takes way too long (hundreds of
years)&nbsp; to compute using the fastest of (super)
computers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Suppose our key is a 128-bit number.&nbsp; There are </p>
<p>340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456</p>
<p>128-bit numbers starting from zero (i.e., 128 bits of 0).&nbsp; To
recover a particular key by brute force, one must, on average, search
half the key space:</p>
<p>170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,303715,884,105,728.</p>
<p>If we use 1,000,000,000 machines that could try 1,000,000,000
keys/sec, it would take all these machines longer than the universe as
we know it has existed to find the key.</p>
<p>This is not the same thing as saying that computational
infeasibility is the same idea as Turing-incomputable. Nor is it the
same thing as saying that you cannot make a lucky guess, or
heuristically arrive at a possible answer, and then systematically
verify that the guessed answer is indeed the correct answer, all done
within a matter of seconds on a lowly PC.&nbsp; Here is an
example:&nbsp; Microsoft Windows NT uses the DES encryption algorithm
in storing the passwords.  Brute-forcing such a scrambled password to
compute the plain text password can take, according to Microsoft,
&quot;about a billion years.&quot; But the L0pht team
(<a href="http://www.l0pht.com"> www.l0pht.com</a>) claims that
L0phtCrack breaks Windows NT passwords in about one week, running in
the background on a Pentium 200 based PC.</p>
<p>In the context of cryptography, the factorization of an arbitrarily
large number N, into its constituent primes, determining the powers
n2, n3, n5, n7, etc. of the primes, is computationally infeasible --
as far as we know.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>N = 2<sup>n2</sup> * 3 <sup>n3</sup>* 5 <sup>n5</sup> * 7 <sup>n7</sup>* 
  ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this, the decryption is computationally infeasible.</p>

<h2>2. One way Hash Function</h2>

<p>A hash function maps input sequences of bytes into a fixed-length
sequence.  The fixed length is considerably shorter than the
typical length (thousands of bytes) of the input, and hence the
function is a hash function. 

<p>The nature of all hash functions is that there must exist multiple
input sequences that map to the same hash.&nbsp; The inverse is a
mathematical relation, not a mathematical function. But, good hash
functions have the following properties: It is hard to <i>find</i> two
strings, from the expected set of typically used strings, that would
produce the same hash value.&nbsp; A slight change in an input string
causes the hash value to change drastically. 

<p>
A &quot;one way&quot; hash function is designed to be computationally
infeasible to reverse the process, that is, to algorithmically
discover a string that hashes to a given value.&nbsp;


<h3>Message Digests</h3>

<p>One-way hash
functions are also known as message digests (MD), fingerprints, or
compression functions. The most popular one-way hash algorithms are
MD4 and MD5 (both producing a 128-bit hash value), and SHA, also known
as SHA1 (producing a 160-bit hash value).</p>

As of 2006, both MD5 and SHA1 are considered separately broken.


<h2>3. Symmetric-Key Cryptography</h2>

<p>Symmetric-key cryptography is an encryption system in which the
sender and receiver of a message share a single, common key to encrypt
and decrypt the message.&nbsp; Symmetric-key systems are simpler and
faster, but their main drawback is that the two parties must somehow
exchange the key in a secure way.  Symmetric-key cryptography is
sometimes also called <i>secret-key cryptography.</i> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If ct = encryption (pt, key), then pt = decryption (ct, key).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3.1 DES</h3>

<p>The most popular symmetric-key system is the DES, short for Data
Encryption Standard<i>.</i>&nbsp; DES was developed in 1975 and
standardized by ANSI in 1981 as ANSI X.3.92. DES encrypts data in
64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key.&nbsp; The algorithm transforms the
input in a series of steps into a 64-bit output.</p>

<h3>3.2 IDEA</h3>

<p>IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) is a block cipher
which uses a 128-bit length key to encrypt successive 64-bit blocks of
plain text. The procedure is quite complicated using subkeys generated
from the key to carry out a series of modular arithmetic and XOR
operations on segments of the 64-bit plaintext block. The encryption
scheme uses a total of fifty-two 16-bit subkeys.</p>

<h3>3.3 Blowfish</h3>

<p>Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher that can be used as a drop-in
replacement for DES or IDEA. It takes a variable-length key, from 32
bits to 448 bits, making it ideal for both domestic and exportable
use.&nbsp; Blowfish is unpatented and license-free, and is available
free for all uses.</p>

<h2>4. Public-Key Encryption</h2>

<p>Public key cryptography uses two keys -- a <i>public key</i> known
to everyone, and a <i>private</i> or <i>secret key</i> that is safe
guarded. Public key cryptography was invented in 1976 by Whitfield
Diffie and Martin Hellman. For this reason, it is sometimes also
called <i> Diffie-Hellman encryption.</i> It is also called
<i>asymmetric encryption </i> because it uses two keys instead of one key.&nbsp;The 
two keys are mathematically related, yet it is computationally infeasible to 
deduce one from the other. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, public-key cryptography is very slow, about 1000
times slower than symmetric key&nbsp; cryptography. </p>

<h3>4.1 RSA</h3>

<p>The most well-known of the public-key encryption algorithms is RSA, named 
after its designers Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman. The un-breakability of the 
algorithm is based on the fact that there is no efficient way to factor very 
large numbers into their primes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find two primes, p and q. </li>
  <li>Compute the product, <i>n = p*q</i> (called, the public modulus). </li>
  <li>Choose e (the public exponent), such that (i) <i>e &lt; n,</i> and (ii) e is 
  relatively prime to <i>(p-1)*(q-1)</i>. </li>
  <li>Compute d (the private exponent) such that <i>(e*d)&nbsp; mod (p-1)*(q-1) 
  = 1</i>. </li>
<li>Public-key is (n, e), and the private key is (n, d). 

</ol>

<p><a href="rsa.txt">An example of the above numbers: rsa.txt</a>.&nbsp; Look up the man page: openssl(1).

<p>The<i> e</i> and <i>d</i> are symmetric 
in that using either ((n,e) or (n,d)) as the encryption key, the other can be used as the decryption key.

<p>The only way known to find <i>d</i> is to know <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. <i>&nbsp;</i>If the number n is small, p and q are easy to
discover by prime factorization.&nbsp; Thus, p and q are chosen to be as large as possible,
say, a few hundred digits long.&nbsp; Obviously,&nbsp; p and q
should never be revealed, preferably destroyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</p>
<p>Encryption is
done as follows.&nbsp; Consider the entire message to be encrypted as
a sequence of bits.&nbsp; Suppose the length of n in bits is b.&nbsp;
Split the message into blocks of length b or b-1.&nbsp; A block viewed
as a b-bit number should be less than n; if it is not, choose it to be
b-1 bits long.&nbsp; Each block is separately encrypted, and the
encryption of the entire message is the catenation of the encryption
of the blocks.&nbsp; Let m stand for a block viewed as a number.&nbsp;
Multiply m with itself e times, and take the modulo n result as c,
which is the encryption of m.&nbsp; That is,&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>c = m^e
mod n</i>.</p>

<p>Decryption is the &quot;inverse&quot; operation:&nbsp; <i>m = c^d
mod n.</i></p>

<h3>4.2 DSA</h3>

<p>The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a United States Federal Government 
standard for digital signatures.&nbsp;&nbsp; <ol>

  <li>
Choose a prime q. Choose a prime modulus p such that p - 1 is a multiple of q.

  <li> Choose g, a number whose multiplicative order modulo p is q. (This may be done by setting g = h^((p 
	- 1)/q) mod p for some arbitrary h (1 < h < p-1), and trying again with a different h if the result comes out as 1. Most choices of h will lead to a usable g; commonly h=2 is used. 
	)<li> Choose x by some random method, where 0 < x < q.

  <li> Calculate y = g^x mod p.

  <li>Public key is (p, q, g, y), and the private key is x.

</ol>

<h3>4.3 Secure Communication Using Public Keys</h3>


<p>Public-key systems, such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), are popular 
for transmitting information via the Internet. They are extremely secure and 
relatively simple to use.&nbsp; You need to retrieve the recipient's public key 
from one of several world-wide registries of public keys that now exist&nbsp; to 
encrypt a message.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When John wants to send a secure message to Jane, he uses Jane's public key 
to encrypt the message. Jane then uses her private key to decrypt it.</p>

<p>In real-world implementations, public keys are rarely used to encrypt actual 
messages because public-key cryptography is slow. Instead, public-key 
cryptography is used to distribute symmetric keys, which are then used to 
encrypt and decrypt actual messages, as follows: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Bob sends Alice his public key.&nbsp; (Or, Alice retrieves Bob's public 
	key from a registry.)</li>
  <li>Alice generates a (random) symmetric key (called a session key), 
  encrypts it with Bob's public key, and sends it to Bob. </li>
  <li>Bob decrypts the session key with his private key. </li>
  <li>Alice and Bob exchange messages using the session key.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4.4 Digital Signatures</h3>

<p>A digital signature is a way to authenticate to a recipient that a received 
object is indeed that of the sender.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Alice computes a one-way hash of a document. </li>
  <li>Alice encrypts the hash with her private key. The encrypted hash becomes 
  the document's signature. </li>
  <li>Alice sends the document along with the signature to Bob.. </li>

  <li>Bob produces the one-way hash of the document received from
  Alice, decrypts the signature with Alice's public key, and compares
  the two values.  If they match, Bob knows that: (i) the document
  really came from Alice and (ii) the document was not tampered with
  during transmission.</li>

</ol>

<h3>4.5. Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) Attack</h3>

<p>The public key-based communication between Alice and 
Bob described above is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. </p>

<p>Let us assume that Mallory, a cracker, not only can listen to the
traffic between Alice and Bob, but also can modify, delete, and
substitute Alice's and Bob's messages, as well as introduce new
ones.&nbsp; Mallory can impersonate Alice when talking to Bob and
impersonate Bob when talking to Alice. Here is how the attack
works. </p>

<ol>

  <li>Bob sends Alice his public key. Mallory intercepts the key and sends her 
  own public key to Alice. </li>

  <li>Alice generates a random session key, encrypts it with
  &quot;Bobs&quot; public key (which is really Mallory's), and
  sends it to Bob. </li>

  <li>Mallory intercepts the message. He decrypts the session key with his 
  private key, encrypts it with Bob's public key, and sends it to Bob. </li>
  <li>Bob receives the message thinking it came from Alice. He decrypts it with 
  his private key and obtains the session key. </li>
  <li>Alice and Bob start exchanging messages using the session key. Mallory, 
  who also has that key, can now decipher the entire conversation.</li>
</ol>

<p>A man-in-the-middle attack works because Alice and Bob have no way
to verify they are talking to each other. An independent third party
that everyone trusts is needed to foil the attack. This third party
could bundle the name &quot;Bob&quot; with Bob's public key and sign
the package with its own private key. When Alice receives the signed
public key from Bob, she can verify the third party's signature. This
way she knows that the public key really belongs to Bob, and not
Mallory. </p>

<h3>6. Digital Certificates</h3>

<p>A package containing a person's name (and possibly some other
information such as an E-mail address and company name) and his public
key and signed by a trusted third party is called a digital certificate (or
digital ID). An independent third party that everyone trusts, whose
responsibility is to issue certificates, is called a Certification
Authority (CA).  A digital certificate serves two purposes. First, it
provides a cryptographic key that allows another party to encrypt
information for the certificate's owner. Second, it provides a measure
of proof that the holder of the certificate is who they claim to be -
because otherwise, they will not be able to decrypt any information
that was encrypted using the key in the certificate.</p>

<p>The recipient of an encrypted message uses the CA's public key to
decode the digital certificate attached to the message, verifies it as
issued by the CA and then obtains the sender's public key and
identification information held within the certificate. With this
information, the recipient can send an encrypted reply. </p>

<p>The most widely used standard for digital certificates is X.509,
which defines the following structure for public-key certificates:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Version field identifies the certificate format.</li>
  <li>Serial Number unique within the CA.</li>
  <li>Signature Algorithm identifies the algorithm used to sign the certificate.</li>
  <li>Issuer Name is the name of the CA.</li>
  <li>Period of Validity is a pair of Not Before, and Not After Dates</li>
  <li>Subject Name is the name of the user to whom the certificate is 
  issued</li>
  <li>Subject's Public Key field includes algorithm name and the
  public key of the subject.</li>
  <li>Extensions</li>
  <li>Signature of CA.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can obtain a personal certificate from companies like
<a href="http://www.verisign.com">verisign.com</a> or <a
href="http://www.thawte.com">thawte.com</a>.</p>
