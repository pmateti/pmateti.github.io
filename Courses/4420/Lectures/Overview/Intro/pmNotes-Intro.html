"People giving security advice often have no idea what the threat
model is. For example, the typical home user's computer has no chance
of being physically attacked. Nobody breaks into people's houses to
install hardware keyloggers to steal their online banking
passwords. And yet, some banks put up "security measures" like
on-screen keyboards you have to type on with a mouse just to avoid
keyloggers. Likewise, there's no real security reason to password
protect your account on your home computer that nobody but you uses,
and no security reason to not use autologin.  Seriously, there is only
one kind of threat the home user faces, and that's software attacks,
none of which are aimed specifically at him, and all of which are
acquired either through his web browser or through infected
executables given to him by his friends. If he runs NoScript, disables
javascript in email, and gets executables only from reputable sources,
there is simply no way he can get infected. If he's on Linux, he's
safer than he's ever going to be already."

Secure computer systems HT2007 (1DT009)
Uppsala University
This course deals with technical aspects of computer security. We cover basic principles and theoretical models for security (e.g. identification, authentication, access control, and information flow control), and practical examples and applications from operating systems, networks, web and databases. We use secure email throughout the course. You learn to identify weaknesses and strengths in computer security.

WebGoat
OWASP WebGoat Project
WebGoat is a deliberately insecure J2EE web application maintained by OWASP designed to teach web application security lessons. In each lesson, users must demonstrate their understanding of a security issue by exploiting a real vulnerability in the WebGoat application.There are currently over 30 lessons, including those dealing with the following issues: 
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) 
 Access Control 
Thread Safety 
Hidden Form Field Manipulation 
 Parameter Manipulation 
Weak Session Cookies 
 Blind SQL Injection 
   Numeric SQL Injection 
 String SQL Injection 
Web Services 
Fail Open Authentication 
 Dangers of HTML Comments 
 ... and many more! 
  For more details, please see the  WebGoat User and Install Guide.

Durzosploit is a javascript exploits generator framework that works through the console. This goal of that project is to quickly and easily generate working exploits for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in popular web applications or web sites. 
Durzosploit does not find browser vulnerabilities, it only is an framework containing exploits you can use.
