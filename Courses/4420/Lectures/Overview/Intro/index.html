  Minimum Grade of D. Students are expected to</p>
<ol>
  <li>Be very comfortable with Linux as a User</li>
  <li>Be familiar with software development on Linux
  <ol type="a">
    <li>gcc, g++</li>
    <li>make</li>
    <li>shell scripts</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Understand system administration tasks</li>
  <li> Remote computers via networking
  <li>Be knowledgeable in practical TCP/IP</li>
</ol>
<h2>Lecture Contents</h2>
<ol>
  <li>All lectures are supported by reading materials on the web</li>
  <li>See the <a href="../Top/index.html"> Weekly Schedule</a></li>
  <li>See the <a href="../Top/syllabus.html"> Syllabus</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>Lab Experiments</h2>

<p>This course is heavily lab oriented.  Most experiments are to be
performed by the student individually with a few that are best learned
when there is a pair of students.  This course depends on Linux for
all its lab experiments.  Most of the details of a lab depend only on
"the" general Linux environment, not on specifics of a distribution of
Linux.

<p>
A typical experiment consists of networking three or four machines
into an isolated network, booting the machines into specially
configured Linux OS, connecting them up so that the middle machine is
a router, run certain programs on the three machines, interacting with
the three machines, and making observations.</p>

<p>In this course, a project rarely involves writing your own
programs.  It generally will require you to build an executable
after suitable reconfiguration using tools such as make.  The
source code tree will be given to you.  The code is in C/C++,
Java, or in (one or two cases) ASM code.</p>


<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>There are two exams: a mid term and a final. These are closed-book, 
closed-notes exams.  I proposed to conduct the exams on-line, but so far, 
students balk at it.  Several of the old exams are on line on the course 
web site.</p>


<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>There are very few good definitions for the terms used in this
area.  Unfortunately, because security breaches are newsworthy,
these terms have been also media-distorted. </p>

<p>We will discuss terms as they become introduced in the
course.  However, let us consider a few terms right away.</p>


<h4>Hacker v. Attacker v. Intruder</h4>

<p>The media uses the term &quot;hacker&quot; in a wholly negative
way.  Whereas in computer science, we think of a hacker as an
experimenter, not interested in &quot;theory&quot;, interested in
results regardless of elegance in solution, and a hackers intentions
may be good/bad.&quot; The <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/">
Jargon File/Dictionary</a> has the following entry:</p>

<dl>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>hacker</b>
    <i>n.</i>  [originally, someone who makes furniture with an
    axe] <b>1.</b> A person who enjoys exploring the details of
    programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as
    opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum
    necessary. <b>2.</b> One who programs enthusiastically (even
    obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing
    about programming. <b>3.</b> A person capable of appreciating hack
    value</a>.
    <b>4.</b> A person who is good at programming quickly. <b>5.</b>
    An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work
    using it or on it; as in `a Unix hacker'. (Definitions 1 through 5
    are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.) <b>6.</b> An
    expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy
    hacker, for example. <b>7.</b> One who enjoys the intellectual
    challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
    limitations. <b>8.</b> <i>[deprecated]</i> A malicious meddler who
    tries to discover sensitive information by poking around. Hence
    `password hacker', `network hacker'. The correct term for this
    sense is
    cracker</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The term `hacker' also tends to connote membership in the
    global community defined by the net (see the network</a> and
    Internet address</a>). For discussion of some of the basics of
    this culture, see the <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/">
    How To Become A Hacker</a> FAQ. It also implies that the person
    described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic
    (see hacker ethic</a>). </p>

    <p>It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to
    describe oneself that way. Hackers consider themselves something
    of an elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which
    new members are gladly welcome. There is thus a certain ego
    satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
    you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be
    labeled ).
    See
    also 
    wannabee</a>. </p>
  </blockquote>

  <dt>Most serious literature on Internet security uses the term
  &quot;attacker&quot; when describing someone who is on the system
  but was not authorized to use the system.  A &quot;script
  kiddie&quot; is an attacker who is invoking scripts and tools,
  without understanding their innards, that others have
  developed.</dt>
</dl>

<h4>DoS (Denial of Service)</h4>
<p>We think of computer systems as providing services to authorized
users.  When a system is deliberately made to crash, or made to run
legitimate users' programs so very slowly that it is unusable by an
attacker, we refer to it as a &quot;denial of service attack.&quot;
The attacker accomplishes this by running certain cleverly composed
programs, and is pre-aware of the consequences.  CERT
(<a href="http://www.cert.org">www.cert.org</a> ):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Examples include </p>
  <ul>
    <li>attempts to &quot;flood&quot; a network, thereby preventing
    legitimate network traffic </li>
    <li>attempts to disrupt connections between two machines, thereby
    preventing access to a service </li>
    <li>attempts to prevent a particular individual from accessing a
    service
    </li>
    <li>attempts to disrupt service to a specific system or
    person</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&quot;Not all service outages, even those that result from
  malicious activity, are necessarily denial-of-service attacks. Other
  types of attack may include a denial of service as a component, but
  the denial of service may be part of a larger attack. </p>
  <p>&quot;Illegitimate use of resources may also result in denial of
  service. For example, an intruder may use your anonymous ftp area as
  a place to store illegal copies of commercial software, consuming
  disk space and generating network traffic.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The escape sequence &quot;<code>\033[4;65536;65536t</code>&quot;
can kill <code> xterm</code> in certain versions of Unix systems.  Is
this a &quot;denial of service&quot;?</p>

<h4>Black Hats v. White Hats</h4>

<p>These are &quot;adjectives&quot; applied to security experts.
White hats are the &quot;good&quot; guys: they are mostly into
forensics and prevention of attacks.  To that end, they ultimately
release all knowledge they gain to the rest of the community, while
initially controlling such release so that vendors and law-and-order
authorities have time to fix things.  Black hats are the
&quot;bad&quot; guys in that they use their knowledge to
unauthorizedly break into even more systems, and pass their knowledge
to other insiders.  They tend to spend enormous hours researching
security weaknesses and do have a work ethic that can be admired but
is at odds with our values. Black hats are almost always known only
via their pseudonyms.  If we ignore ethics related issues, black hats
are charismatic and many are excellent writers (see e.g., articles in
<a href="http://www.phrack.org">www.phrack.org</a> ).</p>

<h2><a name="Reading Assignments">Reading Assignments</a></h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>"There is an oceanic amount of material on network security
    available over the Internet."</p>
  <div align="right">-- A Web Page.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Each lecture of the course is supported by a web article.  This article 
includes at the end a list of annotated references.  Some of these are 
required reading.</p>

<h2><a name="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h2>
<p>These lecture materials are gleaned from many sources.  All
are presented after careful reading.  In some cases, I may have
neglected proper attribution. I assure the reader it is not because I
claim authorship.  Indeed, in the lectures there is hardly any
thing new that I have contributed.  I welcome concrete
suggestions of improvement.</p>

<p>I appreciate comments, complementary or not, constructive or not.</p>

<p>Links when they were first inserted into my articles were working.
I do run run link checkers.  But, fixing broken links is no longer a
priority, since working links can be easily found.  But if you found
"better" (in terms of pedagogy) links, please let me know.
