1. In the context of https://www.wright.edu/coronavirus our lectures
   are asynchronous. Per week, you are expected to watch two lecture
   videos (75 min each) and study the associated lecture notes.  I
   will be posting the lectures on Tue and Thurs.  Around noon.

1. "Office Hours" are through questions/answers posted on Pilot
   Discussion for academic matters, and through emails if they are
   personal.  As needed, we can do video chats.

1. You are expected to have taken CEG2350 OS Usage and Concepts here
   at WSU or an equivalent course elsewhere.  I will try to fill you
   in on most of the missing background/ prerequisites.  A survey for
   that purpose is posted on Pilot.

1. *Pilot Action Item* Submit the written responses to the survey on
   Pilot. Due: Aug 31, 2020.

1. Visit the Course Home Page
   https://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/4420 at least once a
   week.  This has links to syllabus, old exams, lecture videos +
   notes and labs.

1. Click on "Lectures" gives you dir listing: Dated Dirs; Topic Dirs

1. The Dated Dir (e.g., 2020-08-25/) gives/links you the lecture video as
   well as lecture notes.  The videos are stored within Pilot Panopto.
