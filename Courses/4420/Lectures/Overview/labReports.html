<h1>CEG 4420 (or 6420) Lab Report Template</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ol>
<li> This is a template for lab reports of CEG 4420/ 6420.  A lab
  report is
  a <a href="http://www.wright.edu/graduate-school/graduate-thesis-and-dissertation-handbook-procedures">
  technical report</a>.  This applies to both 4420 and 6420 students.
  Sections, page numbers and a Table-of-Contents are a must.
<li>
  The report must include your details at the very beginning: Your
  Full Name, Your preferred email address, Your WSU UID, Your
  WSU/Pilot Login ID, Date(s) of the lab, and Title of the Lab.

<li> Use the section headings shown here, excluding "Submission".
  But, ditch the section content.  Every paragraph that you include in
  the lab report must be *in your own words*.  Exception: Output of
  programs.  Do not copy-paste from other sources, including my
  descriptions of the lab.  If you did, for seriously compelling
  reasons, you must cite the source(s).

<li>Be driven primarily by the following motive.  <i>Suppose you come
  across a lab report of your own, say, two years from now, and
  re-read it.  Can you make sense of it?  Can you recall the important
  thoughts you had and observations you made two years ago?  Include
  all such details.</i>
<li>If you have an unquestionably better way of doing a lab report
  than what is suggested here, go ahead with it.  Include a defense of
  your view point.
</ol>


<h2>Purpose of the Experiment</h2>

My lab description usually has a little paragraph on this.  Write your
version.


<h2>Experiment Setup</h2>

<p>Identify the (i) equipment and (ii) software you used.  Some of
    this will repeat for every lab.  Even so, include it in every lab
    report.  Linux has commands named <tt>lshw</tt>, and <tt>uname
    -a</tt>.  Use it and
    <b>select</b> the important entries.  Do not just dump it.  Most
    software has a flag -v that gives its version number.  Record any
    other details that you think are relevant for the particular lab.



<h2>Experimental Procedures</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The Lab descriptions given are not detailed recipes.  You are
    expected to fill in all the missing details.  Post requests for
    help, if needed, on Pilot.  

  <li>Describe the details of your procedures.  If you literally
    followed the steps in our lab articles, with no changes
    whatsoever, just say so, instead of copy- and- paste.  If you did
    do verbatim copy-and-paste, either from my articles or those
    written by others, you *must* *cite* your source explicitly;
    otherwise, it may be considered plagiarism.

  <li>Labs typically have 4 or 5 tasks.  Include subsections here for
    each task.
</ol>

<h2>Recorded Observations</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Collect all your observations here.  Much of this should be
    verbatim cut-and-pasted from <tt>stdout</tt>, or from a
    redirected <tt>stdout</tt> file.  But grouped, and labeled.  Be
    judicious about how voluminous this is.  Cut out portions that are
    repetitive, or not illuminative.  Include relevant screenshots or
    cut-and-pasted text.  Avoid screenshots of pure text windows.

  <li>Include time stamp/ duration of major steps.  Learn to use the
    command named <tt>date</tt>.

  <li>Labs typically have 4 or 5 tasks.  Include subsections here for
    each task observations.
  <li>Thoughtless cut-pastes make your reports unnecessarily too long.

  <li> This section is an as-was collection of observations, including
    time stamps.
</ol>

<h2>Interpretation of Recorded Observations</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Interpret your recorded observations.  This is the <b>most
    judged</b> part of your report.  Make these stand out.
  <li>Labs typically have 4 or 5 tasks.  Include subsections here for
    interpretation of the observations under each task
  <li>Some students prefer to merge this section with the one above.
    I am not forbidding this.  But, it *is* better to leave these two
    as separate sections.  The Recorded Observations are mechanically
    collectible; your interpretations show how well you understand.
</ol>


<h2>Remarks</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Critique this lab overall. This section should include your
    commentary on all aspects of this lab.  Includes negative as well
    as positive comments.

  <li> Are there any suggestions for improving the lab?

  <li>
    Feel free to include a &quot;personal experience&quot; story in your
    description.  What did you learn? Was something surprising?  Was
    something [unexpectedly] difficult?
</ol>

<h2>Journal</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Include in the PDF a
    <a href="http://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-keep-a-journal-and-how-to-start-yours-1547057185">
      journal</a>.  Include entries related to this course only ;-)
    Record how long each task took.  Record/ describe glitches, if
    any.
 </ol>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>In technical reports, the conclusion section includes both summary
as well as derived statements as ending remarks.

<h2>References</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
  Include a numbered list of references you used.  See the course
  articles for example usage of this section.
  <li> 
    <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/9/linux-commands-hardware-information">
    https://opensource.com/article/19/9/linux-commands-hardware-information</a>
  <li> WSU,
    <a href="http://www.wright.edu/graduate-school/graduate-thesis-and-dissertation-handbook-procedures">
    Tech Report Expectations</a>.  Applies to all students of this course.
</ol>

<h1>Submission</h1>

 
<ol>
  <li> Submit into Pilot-> Assessment -> Dropbox.  (This is not the same as
    <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/"> https://www.dropbox.com/</a>.)

  <li>Submit a single PDF file named *exactly* <tt>Report-Ln.pdf</tt>, where
    n should be replaced with the number of the lab. (Scripts are used
    to check various things -- so file names, and section numbers,
    etc. should obey "rules".)

    <ol>
      <li>
        In this course, we prefer open source tools, but you use what
        ever tools you like to write the lab report.

      <li><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/en/man1/enscript.1.html">
          enscript</a> can convert plain text files and source code
          into colorized PostScript files.
      <li><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/en/man1/ps2pdf.1.html">
          ps2pdf</a> converts PS files to PDFs, and
      <li><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man1/pdfunite.1.html">
          pdfunite</a> can combine several PDFs into one.

      <li>It is recommended that you initially produce one dot-txt
        file for each section, and convert each to a PDF, then
        consolidate them into one PDF file, but name them as separate
        sections.
    </ol>
    
  <li>Source code submission is expected in some labs.  Submit all
    source code as one tar ball named <tt>Ln.tbz</tt>, with sub
    directories in the tar ball, as needed.

  <li>
    Make sure the report never exceeds 20
    pages.  Literally capturing the output can do that.  Not counting
    the Recorded Observations, the entire report is probably under 10
    pages.

  <li>Our standards of how well written the reports are fairly low.
    But, really careless reports will lose points.

  <li> There are 20 points assigned for the lab Report-Ln.pdf [and the
    tarball, etc. if any] for meeting the above expectations of
    editorial quality and compliance.  For non-compliance with the
    template, you will lose points.
</ol>
