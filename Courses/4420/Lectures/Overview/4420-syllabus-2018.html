    <p><b>Catalog Description: </b> This course introduces security
      hardening of a single system.  It explains how malware can
      compromise security and privacy from the moment a machine is
      powered on until shut down.  Topics include Privilege
      Escalation, Buffer Overruns, Kernel and System Program
      Hardening, Static Analysis, CERT Guides on Secure Coding. Lab
      work uses tools such as Kali Linux, and WSU Virtual Cyber
      Security Lab.
      <b>Prerequisites</b>: CEG 4350 OS Internals and Design

</ol>



    <h2>Attendance</h2>

    <p>Full attendance is expected. 


    <h2>Course Content</h2>

    <p>Lab work is a significant part of this course. The ordering of
      lectures, in contrast to the course content topics listed below, is
      largely due to this influence.

    <p>The topics are described at some length because they may be too
      unfamiliar to you.  The numbers in parens are a rough estimate of the
      number of (75-minute) lectures on each topic.

    <h3>Intro (1)</h3>

    <p>Well Known Security Breaches.  Current security events.
      Terminology: E.g., Intruder v. Hacker v. attacker v. cracker.
      Course overview.  Escalation of privileges.  Denial of Service
      (DoS).  Virus, Worms, and Trojans.  Virtual machines.

    <h3>System Administration (2)</h3>

    <p>Linux setup.  Configuring properly.  The initial boot can be a
      significant source of insecurity.  The sequence of events from
      initial power-on cold booting to shut down of a computer system.
      Standard processes: <tt>init</tt> etc.

    <h3>Applied Cryptography (1)</h3>

    <p>Understanding computational infeasibility. Message
      digests. Digital certificates.  Man-in-the-Middle attacks.


    <h3>Authentication (3)</h3>

    <p>User Authentication: /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow files.
      Salting. One time passwords. Two-factor authentication.
      Cracking of passwords.

    <h3>System Hardening (8) </h3>

    <p> Hardening an OS kernel and system programs.  Patching:
      binaries and source code.  Use of diff and patch.  Patching for
      known kernel exploits.  Linux kernel modules.  Linux security
      modules.  Re-design of OS for security.  NSA's Security Enhanced
      Linux.  Absense of Rootkits, unauthorized services, Backdoors.
      Prevention, detection and mitigation of malware.

      <h3>Secure Software Development (6)</h3>

    <p>Buffer Overflow Exploitation.  Software development techniques
      that are resistant to bug exploits.  At the high-level, code
      structure, least privilege, and narrow interfaces, and at the
      low-level, checking for buffer overruns, being ultra careful in
      writing setuid programs, untrusted paths, race conditions,
      environment, etc.  Prevention and detection of race conditions.
      Type-safety, static source code analysis, assertions and
      invariants.

      <h3>System Audit (2)</h3>

    <p>Detection and Documentation of (possible) Intrusions.
      Penetration testing.  Logging facilities.  Intrusion
      Detection Systems (IDS).  Intrusion Prevention Systems
      (IPS).  Forensics.

      <strike>
      <h3 style="color: red"> TBD Ethical and Legal Issues (2)</h3>

    <p> We will discuss topics such as: Why Hackers Do The Things
      They Do?  Is it OK to harden the PC of a neighbor without
      permission?   It is required that you
      sign <a href="../Ethics/ethicsStmt.htm"> our statement of
	ethics</a>.      </strike>

    <h2>Exams 30 + 30%</h2>

    <p>There will be two exams contributing 20%  and 30% to the final
      grade. The mid term is scheduled around the sixth week, and the final
      during the exam week as set by the Registrar.

    <h2>Laboratory Experiments 40%</h2>

    <p> The laboratory experiments contribute 50% to the final grade.
      Lab reports must be submitted by midnight on the due date
      posted.  I will accept up to two lab reports late but each
      within 48 hours.  The subject matter of these experiments is
      included in the exams.

    <p>In this course, a lab rarely involves writing your own
      programs.  It generally will require you to build an executable
      on Linux after suitable reconfiguration using tools such as
      make.  The source code tree will be given to you.  The code is
      in C/C++, or in ASM code.

    <p>Most experiments are to be performed by the student
      individually with a few that are best learned when there
      is a pair of students.  These labs must be work
      done <i>solely by you (and your partner)</i>, except for
      the parts I provided you with.

    <p>I expect to give 8 experiments, each worth 5%.

    <h2> Discussion 5% Bonus</h2>

    <p>Active participation in the group discussions is expected.

    <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>

    <p>There are no homework assignments to be turned in.

    <h2>CEG 6420</h2>

    <p>Students enrolled in CEG 6420 are required to do additional
      tasks at a
      graduate student level. Undergraduate students and graduate
      students will be graded separately.  This semester the tasks are
      to (i) learn and write a technical summary in a few pages on
      two of the topics below, (ii) sketch a new
      lab experiment based on that topic, and (iii) carry out that
      experiment and submit a lab report as usual.  Your article and
      lab experiment should look like one of those already included in
      the course.  If a topic beyond this list interests you, I am
      happy to consider it.
