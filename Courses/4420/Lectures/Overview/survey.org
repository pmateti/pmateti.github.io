You are expected to have taken CEG2350 OS Usage and Concepts here at
WSU or an equivalent course elsewhere.  I will try to fill you in on
most of the missing background/ prerequisites.  The survey below is
for that purpose.  Brief answers/ replies are preferred, but be clear
and answer at length if you like.

Submit the written responses on Pilot.

* Syllabus

1. [[./4420-syllabus.html]]

* Survey

1. When did you take CEG2350? Or, its equivalent: What is the course
   number/ level and exact title?

2. [Without looking up] Define/Describe these terms:
   1. Programs vs Processes
   2. Stack vs Heap
   3. Linking vs Loading
   4. System Calls vs Library Calls

3. How deep is your experience with Linux? Scale: 0 (never used) to 10
   (expert).  This course uses Linux.

4. Are you planning to use for this course work:
   1. Your own desktop/laptop or WSU labs?
   2. Real Linux or installed within Windows VM or [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/][WSL2]]?
