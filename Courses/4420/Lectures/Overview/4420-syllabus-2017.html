    <p><b>Catalog Description: </b>
      This course introduces security hardening of a single system, and how
      to protect it when connected to a network.  It explains how malware can
      compromise security and privacy from the moment a machine is powered
      on until shut down.  Topics include Privilege Escalation, Buffer
      Overruns, Network Packet Mangling, Session Hijacking, Firewalls, and
      ethics. Lab work uses tools such as nmap and Kali (BackTrack) Linux.
      <b>Prerequisites</b>: CEG 4350</p>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>

    <p>Full attendance is expected. </p>


    <h2>Course Content</h2>

    <p>Lab work is a significant part of this course. The ordering of
      lectures, in contrast to the course content topics listed below, is
      largely due to this influence.</p>

    <p>The topics are described at some length because they may be too
      unfamiliar to you.  The numbers in parens are a rough estimate of the
      number of (75-minute) lectures on each topic.</p>

    <h3>Intro (1)</h3>

    <p>Well Known Security Breaches.  The most famous
      incidents. The Internet Worm, 1988.  Current events.
      Terminology: E.g., Intruder v. Hacker v. attacker
      v. cracker.   Course overview.</p>


    <h3>System Administration (2)</h3>

    <p>Linux setup.  The initial boot can be a significant source
      of insecurity.  The sequence of events from initial power-on
      cold booting to shut down of a computer system.  Standard
      Unix processes: <tt>init, getty, inetd, rpc.*</tt> etc.
      Introduction to network setup.  TCP/IP refresher.  Virtual
      machines.</p>

    <h3>Applied Cryptography (1)</h3>

    <p>Understanding computational infeasibility. Message
      digests. Digital certificates.  Man-in-the-Middle attacks.</p>


    <h3>TCP/IP Exploits (2)</h3>

    <p>Modern operating systems are internally organized as a
      networked collection of servers, even when not connected to
      other machines.  Service and node authentication.  Probing a
      Host for Weakness.  Remote Trojans.  Causing service
      denials.  Denial of Service Attacks.  Distributed
      coordinated attacks.  Sniffing. Spoofing.  Secure shell.
      Secure Socket Layer (SSL).  Virtual Private Networks (VPN).
      IPv6.</p>

    <h3>Authentication (3)</h3>

    <p>User Authentication: /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow files. One
      time passwords. Semi-permanently assigned password, and a
      response token generated by credit-card-sized electronic
      authenticators.  Two-factor authentication.  Cracking of
      passwords.</p>

    <h3>System Hardening (8) </h3>

    <p> Escalation of privileges.  Denial of Service (DoS).
      Virus, Worms, and Trojan Horses.  The structure of a computer
      virus.  Manipulation of executable binaries.  Anti-virus
      programs.  Configuring properly.  Hardening an OS.  Re-design
      of OS for security.  NSA's Security Enhanced Linux.  Absense
      of Root kits, unauthorized services, Backdoors.  Honey pots.
      Prevention and detection of malware.

      <h3>Secure Software Development (6)</h3>

    <p>Buffer Overflow Exploitation.  Software development
      techniques that are resistant to bug exploits.  At the
      high-level, code structure, least privilege, and narrow
      interfaces, and at the low-level, checking for buffer
      overruns, being ultra careful in writing setuid programs,
      untrusted paths, race conditions, environment, etc.
      Type-safety, source code analysis, assertions and
      invariants.  Prevention and detection of race conditions.

      <h3>System Audit (2)</h3>

    <p>Detection and Documentation of (possible) Intrusions.
      Penetration testing.  Logging facilities.  Intrusion
      Detection Systems (IDS).  Intrusion Prevention Systems
      (IPS).  Forensics.

      <h3 style="color: red"> TBD Ethical and Legal Issues (2)</h3>

    <p> We will discuss topics such as: Why Hackers Do The Things
      They Do?  Is it OK to harden the PC of a neighbor without
      permission?   It is required that you
      sign <a href="../Ethics/ethicsStmt.htm"> our statement of
	ethics</a>.</p>

    <h2>Exams 30 + 30%</h2>

    <p>There will be two exams contributing 20%  and 30% to the final
      grade. The mid term is scheduled around the sixth week, and the final
      during the exam week as set by the Registrar.</p>

    <h2>Laboratory Experiments 40%</h2>

    <p> The laboratory experiments contribute 50% to the final grade.
      Lab reports must be submitted by midnight on the due date
      posted.  I will accept up to two lab reports late but each
      within 48 hours.  The subject matter of these experiments is
      included in the exams.</p>

    <p>In this course, a lab rarely involves writing your own
      programs.  It generally will require you to build an executable
      on Linux after suitable reconfiguration using tools such as
      make.  The source code tree will be given to you.  The code is
      in C/C++, Java, or in (one or two cases) ASM code.</p>

    <p>Most experiments are to be performed by the student
      individually with a few that are best learned when there
      is a pair of students.  These labs must be work
      done <i>solely by you (and your partner)</i>, except for
      the parts I provided you with.</p>

    <p>I expect to give 8 experiments, each worth 5%.
      each.

    <h2> Discussion 5% Bonus</h2>

    <p>Active participation in the group discussions is expected.</p>

    <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>

    <p>There are no homework assignments to be turned in.</p>

    <h2>CEG 6420</h2>

    <p><strike>This section may get revised some more in the next few
        days.</strike>
    <p>Students enrolled in CEG 6420 are required to do additional
      tasks <strike>amounting to 50% of UG work</strike> and at a
      graduate student level. Undergraduate students and graduate
      students will be graded separately.  This semester the tasks are
      to (i) learn and write a technical summary in a few pages on
      <strike>four</strike> two of the topics below, (ii) sketch a new
      lab experiment based on that topic, and (iii) carry out that
      experiment and submit a lab report as usual.  Your article and
      lab experiment should look like one of those already included in
      the course.  If a topic beyond this list interests you, I am
      happy to consider it.</p>
