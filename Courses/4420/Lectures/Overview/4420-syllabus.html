    <p><b>Catalog Description: </b> Introduces security hardening of a
      single system, and how to protect it when connected to a
      network. It explains how malware can compromise security and
      privacy from the moment a machine is powered on until shut
      down. Topics include Privilege Escalation, Buffer Overruns,
      Network Packet Mangling, Session Hijacking, Firewalls, and
      ethics. Lab work uses tools such as Kali Linux, and AWS.
      <b>Prerequisites</b>: CEG 2350 OS Concepts and Usage.</p>

    <h2>Laptop/Desktop</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> WSU will provide you with an AWS virtual machine.  Get
        ahead and study
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/launch-a-virtual-machine-B-0/"> https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/launch-a-virtual-machine-B-0/</a>

      <li> [Even so] It is highly recommended that you have a real
        desktop/laptop Linux setup [exclusively] for lab experiments
        of this course.  Read
        <a href="https://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/4420/Lectures/LinuxSetup/gettingStartedLab.html">
          Lab on Getting Started</a>, a required lab in this course.
       <li> Become prepared to install a Linux distro of your choice.

    <h3>Attendance</h3>

    <strike>Full attendance is expected.</strike>

    <p> Be aware of <a href="https://www.wright.edu/coronavirus">
        https://www.wright.edu/coronavirus</a> website content.
      Our lectures are asynchronous.
      
    Per week, you are expected to watch two lecture videos (75 min
    each) and study the associated lecture notes.  Visit the Course
    Home Page at least once a week.


    <h2>Course Content</h2>

    <p>Lab work is a significant part of this course. The ordering of
      lectures, in contrast to the course content topics listed below, is
      largely due to this influence.

    <p>The topics are described at some length because they may be too
      unfamiliar to you.  The numbers in parens are a rough estimate of the
      number of (75-minute) lectures on each topic.

      <h3>Intro (1)</h3>

    <p>Well Known Security Breaches.  Current security events.
      Terminology: E.g., Intruder v. Hacker v. attacker v. cracker.
      Course overview.  Escalation of privileges.  Denial of Service
      (DoS).  Virus, Worms, and Trojans.  Virtual machines.

      <h3>System Administration (2)</h3>

    <p>Linux setup.  Configuring properly.  The initial boot can be a
      significant source of insecurity.  The sequence of events from
      initial power-on cold booting to shut down of a computer system.
      Standard processes: <tt>init</tt> etc.

      <h3>Applied Cryptography (1)</h3>

    <p>Understanding computational infeasibility. Message
      digests. Digital certificates.  Man-in-the-Middle attacks.


      <h3>Authentication (3)</h3>

    <p>User Authentication: /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow files.
      Salting. One time passwords. Two-factor authentication.
      Cracking of passwords.

      <h3>System Hardening and Update (8) </h3>

    <p>  Hardening an  OS  kernel and  system  programs.  Patching  of
      binaries and source code.  Use  of diff and patch.  Patching for
      known kernel  exploits.  Linux  kernel modules.   Linux security
      modules.   Re-design/  Hardening  of  OS  for  security.   NSA's
      Security Enhanced Linux.

      <h3>Secure Software Development (6)</h3>

    <p>Buffer Overflow Exploitation.  Software development techniques
      that are resistant to bug exploits.  At the high-level, code
      structure, least privilege, and narrow interfaces, and at the
      low-level, checking for buffer overruns, being ultra careful in
      writing setuid programs, untrusted paths, race conditions,
      environment, etc.  Prevention and detection of race conditions.
      Type-safety, static source code analysis, assertions and
      invariants.

      <h3>System Audit (2)</h3>

    <p>Detection and Documentation of (possible) Intrusions.
      Penetration testing.  Logging facilities.  Absense of Rootkits,
      unauthorized services, Backdoors.  Prevention, detection and
      mitigation of malware.  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
      Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).  Forensics.

      <strike>
        <h3> Ethical and Legal Issues (2)</h3>

        <p> We will discuss topics such as: Why Hackers Do The Things
          They Do?  Is it OK to harden the PC of a neighbor without
          permission?   It is required that you
          sign <a href="../Ethics/ethicsStmt.htm"> our statement of
	          ethics</a>.      </strike>

      <h2>Exams 30 + 30%</h2>

    <p>The mid term is scheduled around the seventh/eighth week, and
      the final during the exam week as set by the Registrar.

      <h2>Laboratory Experiments 40%</h2>

    <p>I expect to give 8 labs, each worth 5%.  Lab reports must be
      submitted by midnight on the due date posted.  I will accept up
      to two lab reports late but each within 48 hours.  The subject
      matter of these experiments is included in the exams.

    <p>In this course, a lab rarely involves writing your own
      programs.  It generally will require you to build an executable,
      on Linux, after suitable reconfiguration using tools such as
      make.  The source code tree will be given to you -- in C/C++, or
      in ASM.

    <p>Experiments are to be performed by the student individually.
      These labs must be work done <i>solely by you</i>, except for
      the parts I provided you with.


      <h2> Discussion 5% Bonus</h2>

    <p>Active participation in the group discussions is expected.

      <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>

    <p>Homework is suggested.  But, there are no homework assignments
    to be turned in.

      <h2>CEG 6420</h2>

    <p>Students enrolled in CEG 6420 are required to do additional
      tasks at a graduate student level.  Undergraduate students and
      graduate students will be graded separately.  This semester the
      tasks are to (i) learn and write a technical summary in a few
      pages on one of the topics below, (ii) sketch a new lab
      experiment based on that topic, and (iii) carry out that
      experiment and submit a lab report as usual.  Your article and
      lab experiment should match the quality of those already
      included in the course.
      <ol>
        <li>Recent Vulnerabilities.  E.g., StackClash, Spectre,
          MeltDown, ShellShock.
        <li>Secure Re-coding of well-known system programs
        (e.g., <code>sudo</code>, <code>fusermount</code>) using
        static analysis tools, such as Splint, LLVM CodeChecker.

        <li>Hardening a Well-Known Linux Distribution (e.g., Kali or
	        Knoppix)
        <li>Devious Boot of Linux
        <li>Survey of Current Ransomware
        <li>Code Injection and ROP
        <li>If a topic beyond this list interests you, I am happy to
            consider it.
