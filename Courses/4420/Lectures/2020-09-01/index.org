* Agenda

** Discretionary Access Control

1. DAC comes with out-of-the-box install  of any Linux distro.  I will
   lecture on a  few items of the DAC lecture  notes.  More in later
   lectures.
1. MAC "Mandatory" Acess Control.  There are several.  This course
   covers NSA SELinux [web search it] in coming weeks.
1. The =sudo=.  Read =man sudoers= Among the many tutorials,
   https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/sudo-beginners-guide/ is
   recommended.  We will be using this "now".
1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid Required Reading.  [Finish
   reading in the next few days.]

** Config

1. {Configuring a [Linux] System Properly}.  Within minutes after a
   fresh install, Linux needs to be configured.  Out of the box, it is
   too permissive.
1. {Lab: Configuring a System Properly} covers these. [Lab is skipped
   this Fall 2020, but it is still part of this course.]
