<h1>Ethics in Internet Security</h1>

<h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti">
  Prabhaker Mateti</a></h3>

<p>Abstract: We present our statement of ethics, and a brief
  discussion of what ethics is in the context of cyber security.  In
  this article, there are many more questions than there are answers.
  Our goal in including the topic of ethics in a course on Internet
  security is to raise your level of awareness even when we cannot
  provide clear-cut answers to ethical dilemmas you may have.  We also
  require reading of the codes of ethics of ACM, and IEEE.</p>

  <h3>Educational Objectives</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Raise the level of conscience regarding ethics particularly in
    the context of network security.</li>
  <li>To distinguish between what is illegal versus unethical.</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Ethics in Internet Security</h1>

<p>Engineering education always includes a course or two on ethics.  A
course like ours must include a discussion even if we cannot deliver
satisfactory answers.
</p>


  <h2>Recognizing Our Ethical Responsibilities</h2>

<h3>The Meaning of Ethics</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/">
  www.merriam-webster.com</a>: Main
  Entry: eth·ic Pronunciation: 'e-thik Function: <i>noun</i>
  Etymology: Middle English <i>ethik</i>, from Middle
  French <i>ethique,</i> from Latin <i>ethice</i>, from
  Greek <i>EthikE,</i> from <i>Ethikos </i>Date: 14th
  century 1 <i>plural but singular or plural in
  construction</i> : the discipline dealing with what is good
  and bad and with moral duty and obligation 2 a : a set
  of moral principles or values b : a theory or system
  of moral values &lt;the present-day
  materialistic <i>ethic</i>&gt; c <i>plural but singular or
  plural in construction</i>: the principles of conduct
  governing an individual or a group; &lt;
  professional <i>ethics</i>&gt; d: a guiding philosophy</p>

<p>The Macquarie Dictionary says: <i>ethics</i> - a system of moral
  principles, by which human actions and proposals may be judged good
  or bad or right or wrong (may refer to a particular class of actions
  - e.g. professional) [derived from a Greek word meaning
  moral] <i>morals</i> - principles or habits with respect to right or
  wrong conduct [derived from a Latin word meaning manners or
  customs]</p>

<p>A few years ago, sociologist Raymond Baumhart asked business people
  &quot;What does ethics mean to you?&quot; [from
  <a href="http://www.scu.edu/ethics/"> www.scu.edu/ethics/</a>]
  Among their replies were the following:

<blockquote>
  &quot;Ethics has to do with what my feelings tell me is right or wrong.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ethics has to do with my religious beliefs.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Being ethical is doing what the law requires.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ethics consists of the standards of behavior our society accepts.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I don't know what the word means.&quot;<br>
</blockquote>

<p>These replies might be typical of our own. The meaning of
  &quot;ethics&quot; is hard to pin down, and the views many people
  have about ethics are difficult to articulate.  Like Baumhart's
  first respondent, many people tend to equate ethics with their
  feelings. But being ethical clearly is not a matter of following
  one's feelings. A person following his or her feelings may recoil
  from doing what is right. In fact, feelings frequently deviate from
  what is ethical.
</p>

<p>Ethics and religion are often coupled in ones mind because of our
  upbringing.  But ethics is not confined to religion, nor is it the
  same as religion.  Most religions, of course, advocate high ethical
  standards.  Ethics applies as much to the behavior of an atheist as
  to that of the saint.</p>
</p>

<p>Being ethical also is not following the law. The law often
  incorporates ethical standards to which most citizens subscribe. But
  laws, like feelings, can deviate from what is ethical. American
  pre-Civil-War slavery laws and the apartheid laws of South Africa,
  are grotesquely obvious examples of laws that deviate from what is
  ethical.</p>

<p> As you can see, these paragraphs are not helpful in distinguishing
    between &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;morals&quot;.</p>

<p>Practical ethics through basic philosophy includes three
  elements: ethical thought; ethical definition; and ethical values.
  If a person conceives of, say, engineering activity, as only making
  money, for example, then one's definition of practical ethics, one's
  actions and values will, be guided by this basic philosophical
  position.  Ethics is defined as a set of rules that clarify right
  conduct from wrong conduct.</p>

<h3>Is Ethics Private or Community Based?</h3>

  <p>Being ethical is not the same as doing &quot;whatever our society
    accepts.&quot; In any society, most people accept standards that
    are, in fact, ethical. But standards of behavior in society can
    deviate from what is ethical.  An entire society can become
    ethically corrupt. Nazi Germany is a good example of an ethically
    corrupt society.<br>

  <h3>That Which is Not Yours</h3>

  <p>Ownership of many things, such as your car, books, computer,
  etc., is usually quite clear.  Do you own the air?  When you buy a
  piece of software, what is it that you own?  The use of it? -- anything
  beyond that?  If you could reverse engineer the source code of the
  program, is the source now yours?</p>

  <p>We are also usually clear that we must not enter some-one's house
    just because they left their back door wide open.  If my files are
  read open, should you assume that you are allowed to read?  What if
  they were also writable? If my computer account has no password,
  should you login as me?</p>

  <h3>Sharing that Which is Yours</h3>

<p>This is a commonly held belief that there is nothing wrong in
  sharing something that &quot;is yours.&quot; Whereas loaning a book
  or a CD to a friend is never considered unethical, to place the
  content of the same on the web and share it is often considered
  unethical and illegal.</p>

<h3>Protecting that Which is Yours</h3>

<p>Nearly all present day effort in Internet security in
  &quot;securing&quot; computer systems, networks, web sites,
  etc. hopes to protect that which is theirs.</p>

<p>You stole it from me, so I can steal it back.  Is this attitude
ethical?</p>

<h3>Tit for Tat</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat"> Wikipedia
  </a>: "Tit for tat is an English saying meaning "equivalent
  retaliation". It is also a highly effective strategy in game theory
  for the iterated prisoner's dilemma. It was first introduced by
  Anatol Rapoport in Robert Axelrod's two tournaments, held around
  1980. An agent using this strategy will initially cooperate, then
  respond in kind to an opponent's previous action. If the opponent
  previously was cooperative, the agent is cooperative. If not, the
  agent is not. This is similar to superrationality and reciprocal
  altruism in biology."
</p>

"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."  -- Mahatma Gandhi.
</p>


  <h3>Squealing</h3>

<p>Suppose you have come across a behavior of a colleague that in your mind is
  clearly unethical.  Should you squeal?  Why is it that squealing has
  such a negative connotation?</p>

<p>Under what circumstances is it either permissible or required for a
  technician repairing a computer to report the contents of files
  found there? A case [Journal of Information Systems Education, 11,
  Summer-Fall 2000, pp. 121-126] of firing of a dean of the Harvard
  Divinity School who had pornographic files on his university-owned
  computer raises questions of privacy
  and <a href="http://www.onlineethics.org/Search.aspx?qsearch=whistle">
  whistle-blowing</a>.</p>
  
<p>In the context of cyber security and privacy, let us focus on
  ethics only, not on morality.</p>

  <a name="Ethics in Internet Security"></a>
  <h2>Ethics in Internet Security</h2>

  <p>It appears that the word "hacker" has become synonymous with
  "attacker", at least in the news media.  We are still trying to keep
  the word and have it refer to a person with good intentions.</p>

  <h3>What is: Intrusion? Hijacking? Privacy Invasion?</h3>

  <h3><a name="Reasons for Hacking">Reasons for Hacking</a></h3>
  <p>To computer wizards, the term &quot;hacker&quot; is reserved for unusually
  clever programmers. To them, the electronic burglars who break into computers
  aren't hackers but intruders, attackers or &quot;crackers.&quot;</p>
  <p>Theft of services: Every system
  offers some type of service, and if a hacker has a use for it, they will hack the
  system. Examples of such systems are on-line information networks.  The 
  question of entitlement may not occur to them.</p>
  <p>Take valuable files: The second reason a hacker may hack into a system
  is to take valuable files, e.g., credit-card numbers, or info on operation of
  telecommunication etc. systems.  Such hackers are clearly aware that their 
  activity is unlawful and they can get prosecuted.</p>
  <p>Vengeance and hate: Another reason for hacking is vengeance and
  hatred.  Causing harm to people and systems belongs here.</p>

  <p>Thrill and excitement: The forth reason hackers break into
  systems is for the thrill and excitement of being somewhere you are
  not authorized to be.  This accounts for the vast majority of
  &quot;true hacking&quot;.</p>
  <p>For knowledge and experiment: The final reason why hackers do what
  they do is just for knowledge and experiment. Hackers learn great deal every
  time they break into a new type of system.</p>


  <h3>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</h3>

  <p>Steven Levy published this book in 1984. Editorial Reviews at
  Amazon.com describes the book as follows. </p>

  <p>"Steven Levy's classic book explains why the misuse of the word
  &quot;hackers&quot; to describe computer criminals does a terrible
  disservice to many important shapers of the digital revolution. Levy
  follows members of an MIT model railroad club--a group of brilliant
  budding electrical engineers and computer innovators--from the late
  1950s to the mid-1980s. These eccentric characters used the term
  &quot;hack&quot; to describe a clever way of improving the
  electronic system that ran their massive railroad. And as they
  started designing clever ways to improve computer systems,
  &quot;hack&quot; moved over with them. These maverick characters
  were often fanatics who did not always restrict themselves to the
  letter of the law and who devoted themselves to what became known as
  &quot;The Hacker Ethic.&quot; The book traces the history of
  hackers, from finagling access to clunky computer-card-punching
  machines to uncovering the inner secrets of what would become the
  Internet. This story of brilliant, eccentric, flawed, and often
  funny people devoted to their dream of a better world will appeal to
  a wide audience."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Levy in this book lists the 
  following hacker tenets:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Access to computers should be unlimited and total. </li>
  <li>Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative </li>
  <li>All information should be free. </li>
  <li>Mistrust authority -- promote decentralization. </li>
  <li>Hackers should be judged by their hacking. </li>
  <li>You can create art and beauty on a computer. </li>
  <li>Computers can change your life for the better. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Do you subscribe to any of them?  Why? Why not?</p>

  <h3><a name="The Hacker's Code">The Hacker's Code</a></h3>

  <a href="petascale.org">Gregory Newby</a> wrote a draft in 2000
  reproduced below.

  <p>Preamble: Hackers are diverse, from all cultures and backgrounds. Every
  hacker is unique, yet we all share some characteristics. While not every hacker
  follows this Code, many believe it is a fair description of our shared
  traditions, goals and values.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Hackers share and are willing to teach their knowledge.
  <li>Hackers are skilled. Many are self-taught, or learn by interacting with
    other hackers.
  <li>Hackers seek knowledge. This knowledge may come from unauthorized or
    unusual sources, and is often hidden.
  <li>Hackers are tinkerers. They like to understand how things work, and want
    to make their own improvements or modifications.
  <li>Hackers often disagree with authority, including parents, employers,
    social customs and laws. They often seek to get around authority they
    disagree with.
  <li>Hackers disagree with each other. Different hackers have different values,
    and come from all backgrounds. This means that what one hacker is opposed to
    might be embraced by another.
  <li>Hackers are persistent, and are willing to devote hours, days and years to
    pursuing their individual passions.
  <li>This Code is not to prescribe how hackers act. Instead, it is to help us
    to recognize our own diversity and identity.
  <li>Every hacker must make his or her own decisions about what is right or
    wrong, and some might do things they believe are illegal, amoral or
    anti-social.
  <li>Hackers' motivations are their own, and there is no reason for all hackers
    to agree.
  <li>Hackers have a shared identity, however, and many shared interests.
  <li>By reading this Code, hackers can recognize themselves and each other, and
    understand better the group they are a part of.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Hacktivism  </h3>

<p>Hacktivism now has entry in the Wikipedia.  As with any
controversial topic, we should understand their views.  Hacktivists
believe in a form of altruistic justice.
</p>

  <h3>Example Questions of Ethics</h3>

  <p>Here are a few examples.  Each of you need to discover your own
    answers, and the answers that our community gives, and how they
    change over the years.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Inserting oneself into a communication link between two other users,
    without their knowledge, is ok to do if the two users are terrorists.</li>
  <li>I was looking at my professor's .emacs to learn how he setup his Emacs. 
    Then, I noticed that his Exams/ directory was read-open.  All the files
    were those of previous terms.  So I made a copy of his directory.</li>
  <li>I bought a PC that came with a Windows 2000 CD.   I don't care
    for Win 2000, so I reformatted my hard disk and installed Linux on it. 
    I gave my CD to a friend who wanted to upgrade from Win 98.</li>
  <li>I was curious how Nessus would work.  On a real network.  So, I
    tried it from a lab.  Unplugged a PC, plugged in my laptop and started
    the scan.  Wow! How many alerts that it showed!  Ooops! It also
    crashed a few machines.</li>
  <li>Three years ago Diane started her own consulting business. She has been so
    successful that she now has several people working for her and many clients.
    Their consulting work includes advising on how to network microcomputers,
    designing database management systems, and advising about security.
    <p>Presently she is designing a database management system for the personnel
    office of'a medium-sized company. Diane has involved the client in the
    design process, informing the CEO, the director of computing, and the
    director of personnel about the progress of the system. It is now time to
    make decisions about the kind and degree of security to build into the
    system. Diane has described several options to the client. Because the
    system is going to cost more than they planned, the client has decided to
    opt for a less secure system. She believes the information they will be
    storing is extremely sensitive. It will include performance evaluations,
    medical records for filing insurance claims, salaries, and so forth.</p>
    <p>With weak security, employees working on microcomputers may be
    able to figure out ways to get access to this data, not to mention
    the possibilities for on-line access from hackers. Diane feels
    strongly that the system should be much more secure. She has tried
    to explain the risks, but the CEO, director of computing and
    director of personnel all agree that less security will do. What
    should she do? Should she refuse to build the system as they
    request?  (Adapted from: Johnson, D. G. Computer Ethics, Second
    Ed.  Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1993.)
    [From <a href="http://www.onlineethics.org/privacy/scene3.html">
	http://www.onlineethics.org/privacy/scene3.html</a>]</li>
  <li>There are many web sites whose names includes "ethical hacking".
    Visit a few. Are they discussing the ethics of hacking at all?</p>
  </ol>

<h3><a name="Our Statement of Ethics">Our Statement of Ethics</a></h3>

  <p>I expect all those attending our class to abide by the following
  statement.  I welcome improvements to the statement.</p>

  <div style="border:blue 1px dotted; padding: 5%">
    <p>
     In this course, I am learning computer-security principles.  It
     is a semester long course, with a prerequisite of operating
     systems and general understanding of computer networks.  I
     realize that this learning is just a beginning. I also realize
     that the tools and techniques that I learn can be put to illegal
     and unethical use.  Therefore, I am signing the following
     statement.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I assure the instructor, and the University that the
      techniques that I am exposed to will be used only for
      educational purposes.  </li>
      <li>I will not engage in or condone any form of illegal activity
      including unauthorized break-ins, cracking, or denial of service
      attacks.</li>
      <li>I will not provide anyone the tools to create mischief.  Nor
      shall I pass my knowledge to others without verifying that they
      also subscribe to the principles apparent in this
      statement.</li>
      <li>As a power user of computers and future network or systems
      administrator, I must be familiar with the tools that may be
      used to bring a network down.  I may engage in a legitimate form
      of hacking, or more precisely, ethical hacking, in order to
      perform security audits with the consent of the legitimate
      owners of the systems being audited.  This is the driving force
      in why I am learning the past attack techniques.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Learning/Teaching of Exploit Tools</h3>

<p>One way that we can all be ethical humans is to have/learn/teach no
skills.  Suppose a tool T presents not much of a case of how it can be
used ethically but it is almost immediately obvious how it can be used
unethically.  Should a university course teach T?  There are many
readily-available cyber security tools that have the attributes of T.
Should a teacher be solely focused on imparting techniques and ignore
how a student may use them?  Can we be sure that a student who signed
the above statement will adhere to it?  For how long?
