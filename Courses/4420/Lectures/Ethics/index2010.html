<h1>Ethics in Internet Security</h1>
<p>We describe our statement of ethics, and present a brief discussion of what
ethics is in the context of Internet security.&nbsp; In this article, there are
many more questions than there are answers.&nbsp; Our goal in including the
topic of ethics in a course on Internet security is not to provide answers to
ethical dliemmas you may have but to raise your level of awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Meaning of Ethics</h2>
<p>From <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary">http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary</a>:&nbsp;
Main Entry: <b>eth·ic </b>Pronunciation: <tt>'e-thik </tt>Function: <i>noun </i>Etymology:
Middle English <i>ethik, </i>from Middle French <i>ethique, </i>from Latin <i>ethice,
</i>from Greek <i>EthikE, </i>from <i>Ethikos </i>Date: 14th century&nbsp; <b>1</b>
<i>plural but singular or plural in construction</i> <b>:</b> the discipline
dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation <b>2 a</b> <b>:</b>
a set of moral principles or values <b>b</b> <b>:</b> a theory or system of
moral values &lt;the present-day materialistic <i>ethic</i>&gt; <b>c</b> <i>plural
but singular or plural in construction</i> <b>:</b> the principles of conduct
governing an individual or a group &lt;professional <i>ethics</i>&gt; <b>d</b> <b>:</b>
a guiding philosophy</p>
<p>The Macquarie Dictionary says:&nbsp; <i>ethics</i> - a system of moral
principles, by which human actions and proposals may be judged good or bad or
right or wrong (may refer to a particular class of actions - e.g. professional)
[derived from a Greek word meaning moral] <i>morals</i> - principles or habits
with respect to right or wrong conduct [derived from a Latin word meaning
manners or customs]</p>
<p>As you can see the dictionaries are not helpful in distinguishing between
&quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;morals&quot;. A few years ago, sociologist Raymond
Baumhart asked business people &quot;What does ethics mean to you?&quot; Among
their replies were the following:<br>
<br>
&quot;Ethics has to do with what my feelings tell me is right or wrong.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ethics has to do with my religious beliefs.&quot;<br>
&quot;Being ethical is doing what the law requires.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ethics consists of the standards of behavior our society accepts.&quot;<br>
&quot;I don't know what the word means.&quot;<br>
<br>
These replies might be typical of our own. The meaning of &quot;ethics&quot; is
hard to pin down, and the views many people have about ethics are difficult to
articulate.&nbsp; Like Baumhart's first respondent, many people tend to equate
ethics with their feelings. But being ethical clearly is not a matter of
following one's feelings. A person following his or her feelings may recoil from
doing what is right. In fact, feelings frequently deviate from what is ethical.<br>
<br>
Ethics and religion are often coupled in ones mind because of our upbringing.&nbsp;
But ethics is not confined to religion, nor is it the same as religion.&nbsp;
Most religions, of course, advocate high ethical standards. Ethics applies as
much to the behavior of the atheist as to that of the saint.</p>
<p>Being ethical also is not following the law. The law often incorporates
ethical standards to which most citizens subscribe. But laws, like feelings, can
deviate from what is ethical. American pre-Civil-War slavery laws and the
apartheid laws of&nbsp; South Africa, are grotesquely obvious examples of laws
that deviate from what is ethical.<br>
<br>
In the context of security and privacy, let us focus on ethics only.&nbsp;
Practical ethics through basic philosophy includes three elements: ethical
thought; ethical definition; and ethical values.&nbsp; <font face="Times">If a
person conceives of, say, engineering activity, as only making money, for
example, then one's definition of practical ethics, one's actions and values
will, be guided by this basic philosophical position.&nbsp; Ethics is defined as
a set of rules that clarify right conduct from wrong conduct.</font>
<h3>Example Questions of Ethics</h3>
<p>Here are a few examples.&nbsp; Each of you need to discover your own answers,
and the answers that our community gives, and how they change.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inserting oneself into a communication link between two other users,
    without their knowledge, is ok to do if the two users are terrorists.</li>
  <li>I was looking at my professor's .emacs to learn how he setup his Emacs.&nbsp;
    Then, I noticed that his Exams/ directory was read-open.&nbsp; All the files
    were those of previous terms.&nbsp; So I made a copy of his directory.</li>
  <li>I bought a PC that came with a Windows 2000 CD.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't care
    for Win 2000, so I reformatted my hard disk and installed Linux on it.&nbsp;
    I gave my CD to a friend who wanted to upgrade from Win 98.</li>
  <li>I was curious how Nessus would work.&nbsp; On a real network.&nbsp; So, I
    tried it from a lab.&nbsp; Unplugged a PC, plugged in my laptop and started
    the scan.&nbsp; Wow! How many alerts that it showed!&nbsp; Ooops! It also
    crashed a few machines.</li>
  <li>Three years ago Diane started her own consulting business. She has been so
    successful that she now has several people working for her and many clients.
    Their consulting work includes advising on how to network microcomputers,
    designing database management systems, and advising about security.
    <p>Presently she is designing a database management system for the personnel
    office of'a medium-sized company. Diane has involved the client in the
    design process, informing the CEO, the director of computing, and the
    director of personnel about the progress of the system. It is now time to
    make decisions about the kind and degree of security to build into the
    system. Diane has described several options to the client. Because the
    system is going to cost more than they planned, the client has decided to
    opt for a less secure system. She believes the information they will be
    storing is extremely sensitive. It will include performance evaluations,
    medical records for filing insurance claims, salaries, and so forth.</p>
    <p>With weak security, employees working on microcomputers may be able to
    figure out ways to get access to this data, not to mention the possibilities
    for on-line access from hackers. Diane feels strongly that the system should
    be much more secure. She has tried to explain the risks, but the CEO,
    director of computing and director of personnel all agree that less security
    will do. What should she do? Should she refuse to build the system as they
    request?&nbsp; (Adapted from: Johnson, D. G. Computer Ethics, Second Ed.
    Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1993.)[From <a
    href="http://www.onlineethics.org/privacy/scene3.html">http://www.onlineethics.org/privacy/scene3.html</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is Ethics Private or Community Based?</h2>
<p>Being ethical is not the same as doing &quot;whatever our society
accepts.&quot; In any society, most people accept standards that are, in fact,
ethical. But standards of behavior in society can deviate from what is ethical.
An entire society can become ethically corrupt. Nazi Germany is a good example
of an ethically corrupt society.<br>

<h3Example Questions of Ethics</h3>
</p>
<h2>Squealing</h2>
<p>Suppose you have come across a behavior of a colleague that in your mind is
clearly unethical.&nbsp; Should you squeal?&nbsp; Why is it that squealing has
such a negative connotation?</p>
<p>Under what circumstances is it either permissible or required for a
technician repairing a computer to report the contents of files found there? A
recent case of the firing of a Harvard administrator who had pornographic files
on his university-owned computer raises questions of privacy and <a
href="http://www.onlineethics.org/glossary.html#WHISTLE-BLOWER">whistle-blowing</a>.</p>
<h2>That Which is Not Yours</h2>
<p>Ownership of many things, such as your car, books, computer, etc., is usually
quite clear.&nbsp; Do you own the air?&nbsp; When you buy a piece of software,
what is it that you own?&nbsp; The use of it -- or, beyond that?&nbsp; If you
could reverse engineer the source code of the program, is the source now yours?</p>
<p>We are also usually clear that we must not enter someone's house just because
they left their back door wide open.&nbsp; If my files are read open, should you
assume that you are allowed to read?&nbsp; What if they were also writeable? If
my computer account has no password, should you login as me?</p>
<h2>Sharing that Which is Yours</h2>
<p>This is a commonly held belief that there is nothing wrong in sharing 
something that &quot;is yours.&quot;&nbsp; Whereas loaning a book or a CD to a friend is 
never considered unethical, to place the content of the same on the web and 
share it is often considered unethical and illegal.</p>
<h2>Protecting that Which is Yours</h2>
<p>Nearly all present day effort in Internet security in &quot;securing&quot;
computer systems, networks, web sites, etc. hopes to protect that which is
theirs.</p>
<p>You stole it from me, so I can steal it back.&nbsp; Is this attitude ethical?</p>
<h2><a name="Reasons for Hacking">Reasons for Hacking</a></h2>
<p>To computer wizards, the term &quot;hacker&quot; is reserved for unusually
clever programmers. To them, the electronic burglars who break into computers
aren't hackers but intruders, attackers or &quot;crackers.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Theft of services:</b> Every system
offers some type of service, and if a hacker has a use for it, they will hack the
system. Examples of such systems are on-line information networks.&nbsp; The 
question of entitlement may not occur to them.</p>
<p><b>Take valuable files:</b> The second reason a hacker may hack into a system
is to take valuable files, e.g., credit-card numbers, or info on operation of
telecommunication etc. systems.&nbsp; Such hackers are clearly aware that their 
activity is unlawful and they can get prosecuted.</p>
<p><b>Vengeance and hate:</b> Another reason for hacking is vengeance and
hatred.&nbsp; Causing harm to people and systems belongs here.</p>
<p><b>Thrill and excitement:</b> The forth reason hackers break into systems is
for the thrill and excitement of being somewhere you are not authorized to be.&nbsp; 
This accounts for the vast majority of &quot;true hacking&quot;.</p>
<p><b>For knowledge and experiment:</b> The final reason why hackers do what
they do is just for knowledge and experiment. Hackers learn great deal every
time they break into a new type of system.</p>

<h2><a name="ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct">ACM Code of Ethics and
Professional Conduct</a></h2>
<b>
<h2><a name="preamble">Preamble</h2>
</a></b>
<p>Commitment to ethical professional conduct is expected of every member
(voting members, associate members, and student members) of the Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM).</p>
<p>This Code, consisting of 24 imperatives formulated as statements of personal
responsibility, identifies the elements of such a commitment. It contains many,
but not all, issues professionals are likely to face.Section 1 outlines
fundamental ethical considerations, while Section 2 addresses additional, more
specific considerations of professional conduct. Statements in Section 3 pertain
more specifically to individuals who have a leadership role, whether in the
workplace or in a volunteer capacity such as with organizations like ACM.
Principles involving compliance with this Code are given in Section 4.</p>
<p>The Code shall be supplemented by a set of Guidelines, which provide
explanation to assist members in dealing with the various issues contained in
the Code. It is expected that the Guidelines will be changed more frequently
than the Code.</p>
<p>The Code and its supplemented Guidelines are intended to serve as a basis for
ethical decision making in the conduct of professional work. Secondarily, they
may serve as a basis for judging the merit of a formal complaint pertaining to
violation of professional ethical standards.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although computing is not mentioned in the
imperatives of Section 1, the Code is concerned with how these fundamental
imperatives apply to one's conduct as a computing professional. These
imperatives are expressed in a general form to emphasize that ethical principles
which apply to computer ethics are derived from more general ethical principles.</p>
<p>It is understood that some words and phrases in a code of ethics are subject
to varying interpretations, and that any ethical principle may conflict with
other ethical principles in specific situations. Questions related to ethical
conflicts can best be answered by thoughtful consideration of fundamental
principles, rather than reliance on detailed regulations.</p>
<h2>1. GENERAL MORAL IMPERATIVES.</h2>
<p><i>As an ACM member I will ....</i></p>
<p><b>1.1 Contribute to society and human well-being.</b></p>
<p>This principle concerning the quality of life of all people affirms an
obligation to protect fundamental human rights and to respect the diversity of
all cultures. An essential aim of computing professionals is to minimize
negative consequences of computing systems, including threats to health and
safety. When designing or implementing systems, computing professionals must
attempt to ensure that the products of their efforts will be used in socially
responsible ways, will meet social needs, and will avoid harmful effects to
health and welfare.</p>
<p>In addition to a safe social environment, human well-being includes a safe
natural environment. Therefore, computing professionals who design and develop
systems must be alert to, and make others aware of, any potential damage to the
local or global environment.
<p><b>1.2 Avoid harm to others.</b></p>
<p>&quot;Harm&quot; means injury or negative consequences, such as undesirable
loss of information, loss of property, property damage, or unwanted
environmental impacts. This principle prohibits use of computing technology in
ways that result in harm to any of the following: users, the general public,
employees, employers. Harmful actions include intentional destruction or
modification of files and programs leading to serious loss of resources or
unnecessary expenditure of human resources such as the time and effort required
to purge systems of &quot;computer viruses.&quot;</p>
<p>Well-intended actions, including those that accomplish assigned duties, may
lead to harm unexpectedly. In such an event the responsible person or persons
are obligated to undo or mitigate the negative consequences as much as possible.
One way to avoid unintentional harm is to carefully consider potential impacts
on all those affected by decisions made during design and implementation.</p>
<p>To minimize the possibility of indirectly harming others, computing
professionals must minimize malfunctions by following generally accepted
standards for system design and testing. Furthermore, it is often necessary to
assess the social consequences of systems to project the likelihood of any
serious harm to others. If system features are misrepresented to users,
coworkers, or supervisors, the individual computing professional is responsible
for any resulting injury.</p>
<p>In the work environment the computing professional has the additional
obligation to report any signs of system dangers that might result in serious
personal or social damage. If one's superiors do not act to curtail or mitigate
such dangers, it may be necessary to &quot;blow the whistle&quot; to help
correct the problem or reduce the risk. However, capricious or misguided
reporting of violations can, itself, be harmful. Before reporting violations,
all relevant aspects of the incident must be thoroughly assessed. In particular,
the assessment of risk and responsibility must be credible. It is suggested that
advice be sought from other computing professionals. See principle 2.5 regarding
thorough evaluations.
<p><b>1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.</b></p>
<p>Honesty is an essential component of trust. Without trust an organization
cannot function effectively. The honest computing professional will not make
deliberately false or deceptive claims about a system or system design, but will
instead provide full disclosure of all pertinent system limitations and
problems.</p>
<p>A computer professional has a duty to be honest about his or her own
qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of
interest.</p>
<p>Membership in volunteer organizations such as ACM may at times place
individuals in situations where their statements or actions could be interpreted
as carrying the &quot;weight&quot; of a larger group of professionals. An ACM
member will exercise care to not misrepresent ACM or positions and policies of
ACM or any ACM units.
<p><b>1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.</b></p>
<p>The values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and the principles of
equal justice govern this imperative. Discrimination on the basis of race, sex,
religion, age, disability, national origin, or other such factors is an explicit
violation of ACM policy and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Inequities between different groups of people may result from the use or
misuse of information and technology. In a fair society,all individuals would
have equal opportunity to participate in, or benefit from, the use of computer
resources regardless of race, sex, religion, age, disability, national origin or
other such similar factors. However, these ideals do not justify unauthorized
use of computer resources nor do they provide an adequate basis for violation of
any other ethical imperatives of this code.</p>
<p><b>1.5 Honor property rights including copyrights and patent.</b></p>
<p>Violation of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and the terms of license
agreements is prohibited by law in most circumstances. Even when software is not
so protected, such violations are contrary to professional behavior. Copies of
software should be made only with proper authorization. Unauthorized duplication
of materials must not be condoned.</p>
<p><b>1.6 Give proper credit for intellectual property.</b></p>
<p>Computing professionals are obligated to protect the integrity of
intellectual property. Specifically, one must not take credit for other's ideas
or work, even in cases where the work has not been explicitly protected by
copyright, patent, etc.</p>
<p><b>1.7 Respect the privacy of others.</b></p>
<p>Computing and communication technology enables the collection and exchange of
personal information on a scale unprecedented in the history of civilization.
Thus there is increased potential for violating the privacy of individuals and
groups. It is the responsibility of professionals to maintain the privacy and
integrity of data describing individuals. This includes taking precautions to
ensure the accuracy of data, as well as protecting it from unauthorized access
or accidental disclosure to inappropriate individuals. Furthermore, procedures
must be established to allow individuals to review their records and correct
inaccuracies.</p>
<p>This imperative implies that only the necessary amount of personal
information be collected in a system, that retention and disposal periods for
that information be clearly defined and enforced, and that personal information
gathered for a specific purpose not be used for other purposes without consent
of the individual(s). These principles apply to electronic communications,
including electronic mail, and prohibit procedures that capture or monitor
electronic user data, including messages,without the permission of users or bona
fide authorization related to system operation and maintenance. User data
observed during the normal duties of system operation and maintenance must be
treated with strictest confidentiality, except in cases where it is evidence for
the violation of law, organizational regulations, or this Code. In these cases,
the nature or contents of that information must be disclosed only to proper
authorities.</p>
<p><b>1.8 Honor confidentiality.</b></p>
<p>The principle of honesty extends to issues of confidentiality of information
whenever one has made an explicit promise to honor confidentiality or,
implicitly, when private information not directly related to the performance of
one's duties becomes available. The ethical concern is to respect all
obligations of confidentiality to employers, clients, and users unless
discharged from such obligations by requirements of the law or other principles
of this Code.</p>
<h2>2. MORE SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.</h2>
<p><i>As an ACM computing professional I will ....</i></p>
<p><b>2.1 Strive to achieve the highest quality, effectiveness and dignity in
both the process and products of professional work.</b></p>
<p>Excellence is perhaps the most important obligation of a professional. The
computing professional must strive to achieve quality and to be cognizant of the
serious negative consequences that may result from poor quality in a system.</p>
<p><b>2.2 Acquire and maintain professional competence.</b></p>
<p>Excellence depends on individuals who take responsibility for acquiring and
maintaining professional competence. A professional must participate in setting
standards for appropriate levels of competence, and strive to achieve those
standards. Upgrading technical knowledge and competence can be achieved in
several ways: doing independent study; attending seminars, conferences, or
courses; and being involved in professional organizations.</p>
<p><b>2.3 Know and respect existing laws pertaining to professional work.</b></p>
<p>ACM members must obey existing local, state, province, national, and
international laws unless there is a compelling ethical basis not to do so.
Policies and procedures of the organizations in which one participates must also
be obeyed. But compliance must be balanced with the recognition that sometimes
existing laws and rules may be immoral or inappropriate and, therefore, must be
challenged. Violation of a law or regulation may be ethical when that law or
rule has inadequate moral basis or when it conflicts with another law judged to
be more important. If one decides to violate a law or rule because it is viewed
as unethical, or for any other reason, one must fully accept responsibility for
one's actions and for the consequences.</p>
<p><b>2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.</b></p>
<p>Quality professional work, especially in the computing profession, depends on
professional reviewing and critiquing. Whenever appropriate, individual members
should seek and utilize peer review as well as provide critical review of the
work of others.
<p><b>2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and
their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.</b></p>
<p>Computer professionals must strive to be perceptive, thorough, and objective
when evaluating, recommending, and presenting system descriptions and
alternatives. Computer professionals are in a position of special trust, and
therefore have a special responsibility to provide objective, credible
evaluations to employers, clients, users, and the public. When providing
evaluations the professional must also identify any relevant conflicts of
interest, as stated in imperative 1.3.</p>
<p>As noted in the discussion of principle 1.2 on avoiding harm, any signs of
danger from systems must be reported to those who have opportunity and/or
responsibility to resolve them. See the guidelines for imperative 1.2 for more
details concerning harm,including the reporting of professional violations.</p>
<p><b>2.6 Honor contracts, agreements, and assigned responsibilities.</b></p>
<p>Honoring one's commitments is a matter of integrity and honesty. For the
computer professional this includes ensuring that system elements perform as
intended. Also, when one contracts for work with another party, one has an
obligation to keep that party properly informed about progress toward completing
that work.</p>
<p>A computing professional has a responsibility to request a change in any
assignment that he or she feels cannot be completed as defined. Only after
serious consideration and with full disclosure of risks and concerns to the
employer or client, should one accept the assignment. The major underlying
principle here is the obligation to accept personal accountability for
professional work. On some occasions other ethical principles may take greater
priority.</p>
<p>A judgment that a specific assignment should not be performed may not be
accepted. Having clearly identified one's concerns and reasons for that
judgment, but failing to procure a change in that assignment, one may yet be
obligated, by contract or by law, to proceed as directed. The computing
professional's ethical judgment should be the final guide in deciding whether or
not to proceed. Regardless of the decision, one must accept the responsibility
for the consequences.</p>
<p>However, performing assignments &quot;against one's own judgment&quot; does
not relieve the professional of responsibility for any negative consequences.
<p><b>2.7 Improve public understanding of computing and its consequences.</b></p>
<p>Computing professionals have a responsibility to share technical knowledge
with the public by encouraging understanding of computing, including the impacts
of computer systems and their limitations. This imperative implies an obligation
to counter any false views related to computing.</p>
<p><b>2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized to
do so.</b></p>
<p>Theft or destruction of tangible and electronic property is prohibited by
imperative 1.2 - &quot;Avoid harm to others.&quot; Trespassing and unauthorized
use of a computer or communication system is addressed by this imperative.
Trespassing includes accessing communication networks and computer systems, or
accounts and/or files associated with those systems, without explicit
authorization to do so. Individuals and organizations have the right to restrict
access to their systems so long as they do not violate the discrimination
principle (see 1.4). No one should enter or use another's computer system,
software, or data files without permission. One must always have appropriate
approval before using system resources, including communication ports, file
space, other system peripherals, and computer time.</p>
<h2>3. ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERSHIP IMPERATIVES.</h2>
<p><i>As an ACM member and an organizational leader, I will ....</i></p>
<p><b>3.1 Articulate social responsibilities of members of an organizational
unit and encourage full acceptance of those responsibilities.</b></p>
<p>Because organizations of all kinds have impacts on the public, they must
accept responsibilities to society. Organizational procedures and attitudes
oriented toward quality and the welfare of society will reduce harm to members
of the public, thereby serving public interest and fulfilling social
responsibility. Therefore, organizational leaders must encourage full
participation in meeting social responsibilities as well as quality performance.</p>
<p><b>3.2 Manage personnel and resources to design and build information systems
that enhance the quality of working life.</b></p>
<p>Organizational leaders are responsible for ensuring that computer systems
enhance, not degrade, the quality of working life. When implementing a computer
system, organizations must consider the personal and professional development,
physical safety, and human dignity of all workers. Appropriate human-computer
ergonomic standards should be considered in system design and in the workplace.</p>
<p><b>3.3 Acknowledge and support proper and authorized uses of an
organization's computing and communication resources.</b></p>
<p>Because computer systems can become tools to harm as well as to benefit an
organization, the leadership has the responsibility to clearly define
appropriate and inappropriate uses of organizational computing resources. While
the number and scope of such rules should be minimal, they should be fully
enforced when established.</p>
<p><b>3.4 Ensure that users and those who will be affected by a system have
their needs clearly articulated during the assessment and design of
requirements; later the system must be validated to meet requirements.</b></p>
<p>Current system users, potential users and other persons whose lives may be
affected by a system must have their needs assessed and incorporated in the
statement of requirements. System validation should ensure compliance with those
requirements.</p>
<p><b>3.5 Articulate and support policies that protect the dignity of users and
others affected by a computing system.</b></p>
<p>Designing or implementing systems that deliberately or inadvertently demean
individuals or groups is ethically unacceptable. Computer professionals who are
in decision making positions should verify that systems are designed and
implemented to protect personal privacy and enhance personal dignity.</p>
<p><b>3.6 Create opportunities for members of the organization to learn the
principles and limitations of computer systems.</b></p>
<p>This complements the imperative on public understanding (2.7). Educational
opportunities are essential to facilitate optimal participation of all
organizational members. Opportunities must be available to all members to help
them improve their knowledge and skills in computing, including courses that
familiarize them with the consequences and limitations of particular types of
systems. In particular, professionals must be made aware of the dangers of
building systems around oversimplified models, the improbability of anticipating
and designing for every possible operating condition, and other issues related
to the complexity of this profession.</p>
<h2>4. COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE.</h2>
<p><i>As an ACM member I will ....</i></p>
<p><b>4.1 Uphold and promote the principles of this Code.</b></p>
<p>The future of the computing profession depends on both technical and ethical

<h2><a name="The Hacker's Code">The Hacker's Code</a></h2>
<p>This is an evolving draft available at <a
href="http://ils.unc.edu/gbnewby/code">http://ils.unc.edu/gbnewby/code</a>.</p>
<p>Preamble: Hackers are diverse, from all cultures and backgrounds. Every
hacker is unique, yet we all share some characteristics. While not every hacker
follows this Code, many believe it is a fair description of our shared
traditions, goals and values.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hackers share and are willing to teach their knowledge.
  <li>Hackers are skilled. Many are self-taught, or learn by interacting with
    other hackers.
  <li>Hackers seek knowledge. This knowledge may come from unauthorized or
    unusual sources, and is often hidden.
  <li>Hackers are tinkerers. They like to understand how things work, and want
    to make their own improvements or modifications.
  <li>Hackers often disagree with authority, including parents, employers,
    social customs and laws. They often seek to get around authority they
    disagree with.
  <li>Hackers disagree with each other. Different hackers have different values,
    and come from all backgrounds. This means that what one hacker is opposed to
    might be embraced by another.
  <li>Hackers are persistent, and are willing to devote hours, days and years to
    pursuing their individual passions.
  <li>This Code is not to prescribe how hackers act. Instead, it is to help us
    to recognize our own diversity and identity.
  <li>Every hacker must make his or her own decisions about what is right or
    wrong, and some might do things they believe are illegal, amoral or
    anti-social.
  <li>Hackers' motivations are their own, and there is no reason for all hackers
    to agree.
  <li>Hackers have a shared identity, however, and many shared interests.
  <li>By reading this Code, hackers can recognize themselves and each other, and
    understand better the group they are a part of.</li>

<h2>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</h2>
<p>Steven Levy published this book in 1984. Anchor 
Books; ISBN: 0385191952; 1st Ed. edition (November 1984).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Editorial Reviews of Amazon.com describes the book as follows. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steven Levy's classic book explains why the misuse of the 
word &quot;hackers&quot; to describe computer criminals does a terrible disservice to many 
important shapers of the digital revolution. Levy follows members of an MIT 
model railroad club--a group of brilliant budding electrical engineers and 
computer innovators--from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s. These eccentric 
characters used the term &quot;hack&quot; to describe a clever way of improving the 
electronic system that ran their massive railroad. And as they started designing 
clever ways to improve computer systems, &quot;hack&quot; moved over with them. These 
maverick characters were often fanatics who did not always restrict themselves 
to the letter of the law and who devoted themselves to what became known as &quot;The 
Hacker Ethic.&quot; The book traces the history of hackers, from finagling access to 
clunky computer-card-punching machines to uncovering the inner secrets of what 
would become the Internet. This story of brilliant, eccentric, flawed, and often 
funny people devoted to their dream of a better world will appeal to a wide 
audience.</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Levy in this book lists the 
following hacker tenets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Access to computers should be unlimited and total. </li>
  <li>Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative </li>
  <li>All information should be free. </li>
  <li>Mistrust authority -- promote decentralization. </li>
  <li>Hackers should be judged by their hacking. </li>
  <li>You can create art and beauty on a computer. </li>
  <li>Computers can change your life for the better. </li>
</ol>
<p>Do you subscribe any of them?&nbsp; Why? Why not?</p>

      <p>In this course I am learning network and computer security principles.&nbsp;
      It is a 10-week long course, with a prerequisite of general understanding
      of operating systems and computer networks.&nbsp; I realize that this
      learning is just a beginning.&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I&nbsp; assure the instructor, the University, and the world that I
          am a caring, responsible, and principled person.&nbsp; I will&nbsp;
          help create a better world.&nbsp; Never will I engage in activity that
          deprives others in order to benefit from it.
        <li>The techniques and links that I am exposed to are for educational
          purposes only.&nbsp; As a power user of computers and future network
          or systems administrator, I must be familiar with the tools that may
          be used to bring a network down.&nbsp;&nbsp; A may engage in a
          legitimate form of hacking, or more precisely, ethical hacking, as a
          consultant who performs security audits.&nbsp; This is the driving
          force in learning the past attack techniques.
        <li>I will not directly provide anyone with the tools to create
          mischief.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor shall I pass my knowledge to others without
          verifying that they also subscribe to the principles apparent in this
          statement.
        <li>I will not engage in or condone any form of illegal activity
          including unauthorized break-ins, cracking, or denial of service
          attacks.</li>
