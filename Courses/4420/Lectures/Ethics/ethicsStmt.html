    <p>
     In this course, I am learning computer-security principles.  It
     is a semester long course, with a prerequisite of operating
     systems and general understanding of computer networks.  I
     realize that this learning is just a beginning. I also realize
     that the tools and techniques that I learn can be put to illegal
     and unethical use.  Therefore, I am signing the following
     statement.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I assure the instructor, and the University that the
      techniques that I am exposed to will be used only for
      educational purposes.  </li>
      <li>I will not engage in or condone any form of illegal activity
      including unauthorized break-ins, cracking, or denial of service
      attacks.</li>
      <li>I will not provide anyone the tools to create mischief.  Nor
      shall I pass my knowledge to others without verifying that they
      also subscribe to the principles apparent in this
      statement.</li>
      <li>As a power user of computers and future network or systems
      administrator, I must be familiar with the tools that may be
      used to bring a network down.  I may engage in a legitimate form
      of hacking, or more precisely, ethical hacking, in order to
      perform security audits with the consent of the legitimate
      owners of the systems being audited.  This is the driving force
      in why I am learning the past attack techniques.</li>
    </ul>
