<p>  This is a template for typical lab reports of
CEG 4420.  Fill-in your details above.  There are editorial comments
(colored green, <tt>color=&quot;#008000&quot;</tt>), like the present
paragraph, that should be deleted from your report.

<p>A lab report is a technical report.  If you are unclear about the
  writing and formatting expectations, please look it up.  Sections,
  and page numbers are a must.  Because there are about twelve to be
  submitted in this semester course, our standards of how well written
  the reports [should be] are fairly low.  Not counting the Recorded
  Observations, the entire report is probably about 5 pages.

<p>Be driven by the following motive.  <b>Suppose you come across the lab
  report of yours, say, two years from now, and re-read it.  Can you
  make sense of it?  Can you recall the important thoughts you had and
  observations you made two years ago?  Include all such details.</b>

<p>
  In this course, we prefer open source tools, but you use what ever
  editor you like, turnin your report as a single PDF file.  If you
  wish, you may use a plain text format instead of this HTML format,
  and any figures should be drawn preferably as &quot;ascii art&quot;.

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/en/man1/enscript.1.html">
enscript</a> can convert plain text files and source code into
colorized PostScript files,
  <li><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/en/man1/ps2pdf.1.html">
ps2pdf</a> converts PS files to PDFs, and
  <li><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man1/pdfunite.1.html">
      pdfunite</a> can combine several PDFs into one.
</ol>

<p>It is recommended that you initially produce one dot-txt file for each
section, and convert each to a PDF, then consolidate them into one PDF
file, but name them as separate sections.

<hr size="1">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">In your own words. Do not copy-paste from my
    description of the lab.</font>

<h2>Purpose of the Experiment</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">In your own words. Do not copy-paste from my
    description of the lab.</font>


<h2>Experiment Setup</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Identify the equipment you used.  Some of
    this will repeat for every lab.  Even so, include in every lab
    report.  Linux has a command named <tt>lshw</tt>.  Use it and
    <b>select</b> the important entries.  Record the IP addresses, and
    Ethernet MAC addresses.  Record any other details that you think
    are relevant for the particular lab.  E.g., on labs that are
    network based, give ifconfig and route -n details of each of the
    machines in your LANs.  E.g., on a password cracking lab, describe
    the CPU/GPU RAM details.
</font></p>


<h2>Experimental Procedures</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Copy, paste and edit as needed the procedures
given in the article on our web lecture notes corresponding to this
lab.  Any time you include verbatim copy-and-paste, from my articles
or those written by others, you *must* *cite* your source explicitly.  If
you literally followed the steps in our lab articles, with no changes
whatsoever, just say so instead of copy and paste.</font></p>


<h2>Recorded Observations</h2>


<p><font color="#008000">Collect all your observations here.  Much of
this should be verbatim cut-and-pasted from <tt>stdout</tt>, or from a
redirected <tt>stdout</tt> file.  But grouped, and labeled.  Be
judicious about how voluminous this is.  Cut out portions that are
repetitive, or not illuminative.  Include relevant screenshots or
cut-and-pasted text.  Avoid screenshots of pure text windows
</font></p>


<p><font color="#008000">Include time stamp/ duration of major
steps.</font></p>

<h2>Interpretation of Recorded Observations</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Interpret your recorded observations.  This
is the most judged part of your report.  I prefer the above two
sections to be separate; however, you should refer to each other
"point by point".
</font></p>


<h2>Remarks/ Journal</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">
Include in the PDF a
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/why-you-should-keep-a-journal-and-how-to-start-yours-1547057185">
  journal</a>.  Include entries related to this course only ;-) Make
it a section.  Always include a &quot;personal experience&quot; story
in your description.  What did you learn? Was something surprising?
Was something difficult?  Record how long each task took. Record/
describe glitches, if any. Critique this lab overall. This section
should include your commentary on all aspects of this lab.  Are there
any suggestions for improving the lab?
 </font></p>


<h2>Witness Report</h2>

<p><font color="#008000"><strike>A number of labs require that you
find a witness who has watched (seen? noticed?) you perform the lab.
It would be good to find a witness who understands the lab.  If you
did the lab completely alone in the OSIS lab, or in a network outside
the WSU perimeter, state this fact.  In this case, we may ask you to
demo this to us in the OSIS lab.</strike>

<p>No witness report is needed.</font></p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p><font color="#008000"> Submit a PDF file named
*exactly* <tt>report-Ln.pdf</tt>, where n should be replaced with the
number of the lab. (Scripts are used to check various things -- so
file names should obey "rules".)  Submit all source code as one tar
ball, with sub directories as needed.
</font></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">In technical reports, the conclusion section
includes both summary as well as derived statements as ending
remarks.</font></p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Include a numbered list of references you
used.  See the course articles for example usage of this section.
</font></p>
