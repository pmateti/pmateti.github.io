<p><font color="#008000">This is a template for typical lab reports of
CEG 4420.  Fill-in your details above.  There are editorial comments
(colored green,<tt> color=&quot;#008000&quot;</tt>) like the present
paragraph that should be deleted from your report.  If you wish, you
may use a plain text format instead of this HTML format, and any
figures should be drawn preferably as &quot;ascii art&quot;.  In this
course, we prefer open source tools, but you use what ever editor you
like, turnin your report as a PDF file.  There may be additional
requirements described for a specific experiment.</font></p>

<p><font color="#008000">A lab report is a technical report.  Because
there are about eight to be submitted in this 10 week course, our
standards of how well written the report should be are fairly low.
Not counting the Recorded Observations, the entire report is probably
about 2 pages.</font></p>

<p><font color="#008000">Be driven by the following motive.  
Suppose you come across the lab report of yours, say, two years from now, and 
re-read it.  Can you make sense of it?  Can you recall the important 
thoughts you had  and observations you made two years ago?  Include 
all such details.</font></p>

<p><font color="#008000">Submit your report using the 
<tt>~pmateti/ceg4420/turnin</tt> program while logged in 
<tt>gandalf.cs.wright.edu</tt>.  Its first argument is the lab name
(e.g., L3 or Lc) and subsequent arguments are path-names of files you wish to
submit.  The report is almost always a single PDF file.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>Purpose of the Experiment</h2>

<h2>Experiment Setup</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Identify the equipment you used.  Some of
this will repeat for every lab.  Currently, in OSIS Lab, this is a
Dell PC with such and such hardware.  Record the IP addresses, and
Ethernet MAC addresses.  Record any other details that you think are
relevant for the particular lab.  E.g., on labs that are network
based, give ifconfig and route -n details of each of the machines in
your LANs.  E.g., on a password cracking lab, describe the CPU/GPU RAM
details.
</font></p>


<h2>Experimental Procedures</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Copy, paste and edit as needed the procedures
given in the article on our web corresponding to this lab.  Any time
you include verbatim copy-and-paste, from my articles or those written
by others, you must cite your source explicitly.  If you literally
followed the steps in our lab articles, with no changes whatsoever,
just say so instead of copy and paste.</font></p>


<h2>Recorded Observations</h2>


<p><font color="#008000">Collect all your observations here.  Much of
this should be verbatim cut-and-pasted from <tt>stdout</tt>, or from a
redirected <tt>stdout</tt> file.  Be judicious about how voluminous
this is.  Cut out portions that are repetitive, or not
illuminative.</font></p>


<p><font color="#008000">Include time stamp/ duration of major
steps.</font></p>

<h2>Interpretation of Recorded Observations</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Interpret your recorded
observations.</font></p>


<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Always include a &quot;personal
experience&quot; story in your description.  What did you learn? Was
something surprising?  Was something difficult?  How long did it take
to complete the lab?  Are there any suggestions? </font></p>
<h2><strike>Witness Report</strike></h2>

<p><font color="#008000"><strike>A number of labs require that you
find a witness who has watched (seen? noticed?) you perform the lab.
It would be good to find a witness who understands the lab.  If you
did the lab completely alone in the OSIS lab, or in a network outside
the WSU perimeter, state this fact.  In this case, we may ask you to
demo this to us in the OSIS lab.</strike>  No witness report is
needed.</font></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p><font color="#008000">In technical reports, the conclusion section
includes both summary/derived statements as well as ending
remarks.</font></p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p><font color="#008000">Include a numbered list of references you
used.  See the course articles for example usage of this section.
