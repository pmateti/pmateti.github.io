<h1>Viruses, Worms and Trojans</h1>
<p align="right"><i>Unix.&nbsp; The world's first computer virus.</i><br>
Title of Chapter 1 of The Unix Haters Handbook, ISBN: 1-56884-203-1</p>
<p>The above is indeed the title of a chapter! The book is in fact 
written by serious computer scientists.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we must 
disregard the suggestion that Unix is a virus as an attempt at being 
hilarious.&nbsp; Equally unhelpful are the news media that use the term 
virus in referring to <i>any</i> piece of malicious software. The 
academic world uses the term &quot;malware'' for these.&nbsp; Rigorous 
definitions have been given by many computer security experts but they 
do not match the typical use even by other security experts.&nbsp; Thus, 
we must settle for practical &quot;definitions&quot; of malicious software.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul class="itemizedlist">
  <li><i>Security tools and toolkits</i> are designed to be used by 
  security professionals to protect their sites.&nbsp; These can also be 
  used by unauthorized individuals to probe for weaknesses.&nbsp; Many 
  of the programs that fall in the malware categories below have 
  benevolent uses. For example, worms can be used to distribute 
  computation on idle processors; back doors are useful for debugging 
  programs; and viruses can be written to update source code and patch 
  bugs.&nbsp; The <i>purpose</i>, not the approach, makes a program 
  malicious.</li>
  <li><i>Back doors,</i> sometimes called <i>trap doors</i>, allow 
  unauthorized access to your system.</li>
  <li><i>Logic bombs </i>are programmed threats that lie dormant for an 
  extended period of time until they are triggered; at this point, they 
  perform a function that is not the intended function of the program in 
  which they are contained. Logic bombs usually are embedded in programs 
  by software developers who have legitimate access to the system.</li>
  <li><i>Viruses</i> are &quot;programs&quot; that modify other programs on a 
  computer, inserting copies of themselves.&nbsp; Viruses are not 
  distinct programs&nbsp;- they cannot run on their own, and need to have 
  some host program, of which they are a part, executed to activate 
  them.</li>
  <li><i>Worms</i> are programs that propagate from computer to computer 
  on a network, without necessarily modifying other programs on the 
  target machines.&nbsp; Worms&nbsp; can run independently and travel 
  from machine to machine across network connections; worms may have 
  portions of themselves running on many different machines. Worms do 
  not change other programs, although they may carry other code that 
  does (for example, a true virus).</li>
  <li><i>Trojan horses</i> are programs that appear to have one function 
  but actually perform another function. Trojan horses are named after 
  the Trojan horse of myth. Analogous to their namesake, modern-day 
  Trojan horses resemble a program that the user wishes to run&nbsp;- a game, 
  a spreadsheet, or an editor. While the program appears to be doing 
  what the user wants, it is also doing something else unrelated to its 
  advertised purpose, and without the user's knowledge.</li>
  <li><i>Bacteria</i>, or <i>rabbit programs, </i>make copies of 
  themselves to overwhelm a computer system's resources. Bacteria do not 
  explicitly damage any files. Their sole purpose is to replicate 
  themselves. A typical bacteria program may do nothing more than 
  execute two copies of itself simultaneously on multiprogramming 
  systems, or perhaps create two new files, each of which is a copy of 
  the original source file of the bacteria program. Both of those 
  programs then may copy themselves twice, and so on. Bacteria reproduce 
  exponentially, eventually taking up all the processor capacity, 
  memory, or disk space, denying the user access to those resources.</li>
  <li>A <i>dropper</i> is a program that is not a virus, nor is it 
  infected with a virus, but when run it installs a virus into memory, 
  on to the disk, or into a file. Droppers have been written sometimes 
  as a convenient carrier for a virus, and sometimes as an act of 
  sabotage. Some anti-virus programs try to detect droppers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Virus Varieties</h2>
<h3>Stealth Virus</h3>
<p>A <i>stealth</i> virus&nbsp; has code in it that seeks to conceal 
itself from discovery or defends itself against attempts to analyze or 
remove it.&nbsp; The stealth virus adds itself to a file or boot sector 
but, when you examine, it appears normal and unchanged. The stealth 
virus performs this trickery by staying in memory after it is executed. 
From there, it monitors and intercepts your system calls. When the 
system seeks to open an infected file, the stealth virus displays the 
uninfected version, thus hiding itself. </p>
<h3>Macro Viruses</h3>
<p>Macro languages are (often) equal in power to ordinary programming 
languages such as C.&nbsp; A program written in a macro language is 
interpreted by the application.&nbsp; Macro languages are conceptually 
no different from so-called scripting languages.&nbsp; Gnu Emacs uses 
Lisp, most Microsoft applications use Visual Basic Script as macro 
languages. The typical use of a macro in applications, such as MS Word, 
is to extend the features of the application. Some of these macros, 
known as auto-execute macros, are executed in response to some event, 
such as opening a file, closing a file, starting an application, and 
even pressing a certain key.&nbsp; A macro virus is a piece of 
self-replicating code inserted into an auto-execute macro. Once a macro 
is running, it copies itself to other documents, delete files, etc.&nbsp; 
Another type of hazardous macro is one named for an existing command of 
the application.&nbsp; For example, if a macro named FileSave exists in 
the &quot;normal.dot&quot; template of MS Word, that macro is executed whenever 
you choose the Save command on the File menu. Unfortunately, there is 
often no way to disable such features.</p>
<p>In May 2000, an OutLook mail program macro virus propagated widely.&nbsp; 
We recommend a visit to <a href="http://all.net/journal/cohen0504-2.htm">

Description of the LOVELETTER Virus&quot;.</p>
<h3>Unix/Linux Viruses</h3>
<p>The most famous of&nbsp; the security incidents in the last decade 
was the Internet Worm incident which began from a Unix system.&nbsp; But 
Unix systems were considered virus-immune -- not so.&nbsp; Several Linux 
viruses have been discovered. The Staog virus first appeared in 1996 and 
was written in assembly language by the VLAD virus writing group, the 
same group responsible for creating the first Windows 95 virus called 
Boza.</p>
<p>Like the Boza virus, the Staog virus is a proof-of-concept virus to 
demonstrate the potential of Linux virus writing without actually 
causing any real damage. Still, with the Staog assembly language source 
code floating around the Internet, other virus writers are likely to 
study and modify the code to create new strains of Linux viruses in the 
future. </p>
<p>The second known Linux virus is called the Bliss virus. Unlike the 
Staog virus, the Bliss virus can not only spread in the wild, but also 
possesses a potentially dangerous payload that could wipe out data. </p>
<p>While neither virus is a serious threat to Linux systems, Linux and 
other Unix systems will not remain&nbsp; virus-free.&nbsp; Fortunately, 
Linux virus writing is more difficult than macro virus writing for 
Windows, so the greatest virus threat still remains with Windows.&nbsp;

<h2>Spreading Malware via the Internet</h2>
<p>Whereas a Trojan horse is delivered pre-built, a virus infects.&nbsp; 
In the past, such malicious programs arrived via tapes and disks, and 
the spread of a virus around the world took many months.&nbsp; Antivirus 
companies had time to identify a new viral strain, and create cleaning 
procedures.&nbsp; Today, Trojan horses, and viruses are network 
deliverable as E-mail, Java applets, ActiveX controls, JavaScripted 
pages, CGI-BIN scripts, or as self-extracting packages.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Integrated mail systems such as Microsoft Outlook make it very simple 
to send not only a quick note edited within a limited text editor but 
also previously composed computer documents of arbitrary complexity to 
anyone, and to work with objects that you receive via standards such as 
MIME. They also support application programming interfaces (such as 
MAPI) that allow programs to send and process mail automatically. Well 
over 500 million E-mail messages are delivered daily in July 2000. </p>
<p>Mobile-program systems are becoming more and more widespread.&nbsp; 
The most widely-hyped examples today are Java and ActiveX.&nbsp; This 
technology became popular with Web servers and browsers, but it is now 
integrated (e.g., Java into Lotus Notes, and ActiveX into Outlook) mail 
systems. Both Java and ActiveX have been found to have security bugs.
</p>
<h2>Structure of Viruses</h2>
<p>Here is a simple structure of a virus.&nbsp; In the infected binary, 
at a known byte location in the file, a virus inserts a signature byte 
used to determine if a potential carrier program has been previously 
infected.</p>
<pre>V()
{
  infectExecutable();
  if (triggered()) {
    doDamage();
  }
  jump to main of infected program;
}


void infectExecutable()
{
 file = chose an uninfected executable file;
 prepend V to file;
}


void doDamage() {
   ...
}


int triggered()
{
  return (some test? 1 : 0);
}
</pre>
<p>The above virus makes the infected file longer than it was, making it 
easy to spot.&nbsp; There are many techniques to leave the file length 
and even a check sum unchanged and yet infect.&nbsp; For example, many 
executable files often contain long sequences of zero bytes, which can 
be replaced by the virus and re-generated.&nbsp; It is also possible to 
compress the original executable code like the typical Zip programs do, 
and uncompress before execution and pad with bytes so that the check sum 
comes out to be what it was. </p>
<h2>Virus Detection</h2>
<p>Known viruses are by far the most common security problem on modern 
computer systems. Several web sites maintain complete lists of known 
viruses.&nbsp; There are thousands.&nbsp; Visit, e.g.,
<a href="http://www.cai.com/virusinfo/encyclopedia/">www.cai.com/ 
virusinfo/ encyclopedia/</a>.&nbsp; In the month of July 2000, there 
were 200+ &quot;PC Viruses in the Wild&quot; (<a href="http://www.wildlist.org/">www. 
wildlist. org</a>).&nbsp; Virus detection programs analyze a suspect 
program for the presence of known viruses.</p>
<p>Fred Cohen has proven mathematically that perfect detection of 
unknown viruses is impossible: no program can look at other programs and 
say either &quot;a virus is present&quot; or &quot;no virus is present&quot;, and always be 
correct. But, in the real world, most new viruses are sufficiently like 
old viruses that the same sort of scanning that finds known viruses also 
finds the new ones. And there are a large number of heuristic tricks 
that anti-virus programs use to detect new viruses, based either on how 
they look, or what they do. These heuristics are only sometimes 
successful, but since brand-new viruses are comparatively rare, they are 
sufficient to the purpose.</p>
<p>Virus scanners are sometimes classified by their &quot;generation.&quot;&nbsp; 
The first generation virus scanners used previously obtained a virus 
signature, a bit pattern, to detect a known virus. They record and check 
the length of all executables. The second generation scans executables 
with heuristic rules, looking, e.g., for fragments of code associated 
with a typical virus. They also do integrity checking by calculating a 
checksum of a program and storing somewhere else the encrypted checksum. 
The third generation use a memory resident program to monitor the 
execution behavior of programs to identify a virus by the types of 
action that the virus takes. The fourth Generation Virus Detection 
combines all previous approaches and includes access control 
capabilities. </p>
<p>It is very educational to study the details of a scanner.&nbsp; The

C++,&quot; Proceedings of the 8th Computer Security Applications Conference,
