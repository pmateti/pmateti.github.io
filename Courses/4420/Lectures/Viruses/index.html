  </blockquote>

  <p>The above book is in fact written by serious computer
  scientists. Nevertheless, we must disregard the suggestion that
  Unix is a virus as an attempt at being hilarious. Equally
  unhelpful are the news media that use the term virus in referring
  to <i>any</i> piece of malicious software. The academic world
  uses the term "malware" for these. The <i>purpose</i>, not the
  approach, makes a program malicious. Many of the programs that
  fall in the malware categories have benevolent uses. For example,
  worms can be used to distribute computation on idle processors;
  back doors are useful for debugging programs; and viruses can be
  written to update source code and patch bugs. Rigorous
  definitions have been given by many computer security experts but
  they do not match the typical use even by other security experts.
  Thus, we must settle for "practical definitions" of malicious
  software.</p>

  <h1>1. <a name="Viruses" id="Viruses">Viruses</a></h1>

  <ul>
    <li><i>Viruses</i> are executable code pieces that modify other
    programs on a computer, inserting copies of themselves. A program
    is a file that adheres to a strict description of how its content
    is organized. On Linux systems, the ELF document of some 50-pages
    describes this format. In this sense, viruses are not programs --
    they cannot run on their own, and need to become part of some host
    program. When such an infected program is executed, the virus
    attaches itself to another and so on. To evade detection, viruses
    are deliberately broken up and the code is scatter-inserted into
    the host porgram.  Computer science use of the word is intended to
    mirror its use in biology.</li>

    <li><i>Bacteria</i>, or <i>rabbit programs,</i> make copies of
    themselves to overwhelm a computer system's resources. Bacteria
    do not explicitly damage any files. Their sole purpose is to
    replicate themselves. A typical bacteria program may do nothing
    more than execute two copies of itself simultaneously on
    multiprogramming systems, or perhaps create two new files, each
    of which is a copy of the original source file of the bacteria
    program. Both of those programs then may copy themselves twice,
    and so on. Bacteria reproduce exponentially, eventually taking
    up all the processor capacity, memory, or disk space, denying
    the user access to those resources.</li>

    <li>A <i>dropper</i> is a program that is not a virus, nor is
    it infected with a virus, but when run it installs a virus into
    memory, on to the disk, or into a file. Droppers have been
    written sometimes as a convenient carrier for a virus, and
    sometimes as an act of sabotage. Some anti-virus programs try
    to detect droppers.</li>

    <li>[From <a href=
    "http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/refa.html">
        http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/refa.html</a>
    ] <i>Blended threats</i> combine the characteristics of
    viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, and malicious code with server
    and Internet vulnerabilities to initiate, transmit, and spread
    an attack. By using multiple methods and techniques, blended
    threats can rapidly spread and cause widespread damage.
    Characteristics of blended threats include:<br>
    <br>
    * Causes harm: Launches a Denial of Service (DoS) attack at a
    target IP address, defaces Web servers, or plants Trojan Horse
    programs for later execution.<br>
    * Propagates by multiple methods: Scans for vulnerabilities to
    compromise a system, such as embedding code in HTML files on a
    server, infecting visitors to a compromised Web site, or
    sending unauthorized email from compromised servers with a worm
    attachment.<br>
    * Attacks from multiple points: Injects malicious code into the
    .exe files on a system, raises the privilege level of the guest
    account, creates world read and writeable network shares, makes
    numerous registry changes, and adds script code into HTML
    files.<br>
    * Spreads without human intervention: Continuously scans the
    Internet for vulnerable servers to attack.<br>
    * Exploits vulnerabilities: Takes advantage of known
    vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, HTTP input
    validation vulnerabilities, and known default passwords to gain
    unauthorized administrative access.<br>
    <br>
    Effective protection from blended threats requires a
    comprehensive security solution that contains multiple layers
    of defense and response mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Virus Varieties</h2>

  <h3>Stealth Virus</h3>

  <p>A <i>stealth</i> virus has code in it that seeks to conceal
  itself from discovery or defends itself against attempts to
  analyze or remove it. The stealth virus adds itself to a file or
  boot sector but, when you examine, it appears normal and
  unchanged. The stealth virus performs this trickery by staying in
  memory after it is executed. From there, it monitors and
  intercepts your system calls. When the system seeks to open an
  infected file, the stealth virus displays the uninfected version,
  thus hiding itself.</p>

  <h3>Macro Viruses</h3>

  <p>Macro languages are (often) equal in power to ordinary
  programming languages such as C. A program written in a macro
  language is interpreted by the application. Macro languages are
  conceptually no different from so-called scripting languages. Gnu
  Emacs uses Lisp, most Microsoft applications use Visual Basic
  Script as macro languages. The typical use of a macro in
  applications, such as MS Word, is to extend the features of the
  application. Some of these macros, known as auto-execute macros,
  are executed in response to some event, such as opening a file,
  closing a file, starting an application, and even pressing a
  certain key. A macro virus is a piece of self-replicating code
  inserted into an auto-execute macro. Once a macro is running, it
  copies itself to other documents, delete files, etc. Another type
  of hazardous macro is one named for an existing command of the
  application. For example, if a macro named FileSave exists in the
  "normal.dot" template of MS Word, that macro is executed whenever
  you choose the Save command on the File menu. Unfortunately,
  there is often no way to disable such features.</p>

  <p>In May 2000, an OutLook mail program macro virus called
  LOVELETTER propagated widely.</p>

  <h3>Unix/Linux Viruses</h3>

  <p>The most famous of the security incidents in the last decade
  was the Internet Worm incident which began from a Unix system.
  But Unix systems were considered virus-immune -- not so. Several
  Linux viruses have been discovered. The Staog virus first
  appeared in 1996 and was written in assembly language by the VLAD
  virus writing group, the same group responsible for creating the
  first Windows 95 virus called Boza.</p>

  <p>Like the Boza virus, the Staog virus is a proof-of-concept
  virus to demonstrate the potential of Linux virus writing without
  actually causing any real damage. Still, with the Staog assembly
  language source code floating around the Internet, other virus
  writers are likely to study and modify the code to create new
  strains of Linux viruses in the future.</p>

  <p>The second known Linux virus is called the Bliss virus. Unlike
  the Staog virus, the Bliss virus can not only spread in the wild,
  but also possesses a potentially dangerous payload that could
  wipe out data.</p>

  <p>While neither virus is a serious threat to Linux systems,
  Linux and other Unix systems will not remain virus-free.
  Fortunately, Linux virus writing is more difficult than macro
  virus writing for Windows, so the greatest virus threat still
  remains with Windows. [July 2000, <a href=

  <h2>Spreading Malware via the Internet</h2>

  <p>Whereas a Trojan horse is delivered pre-built, a virus
  infects. In the past, such malicious programs arrived via tapes
  and disks, and the spread of a virus around the world took many
  months. Antivirus companies had time to identify a new viral
  strain, and create cleaning procedures. Today, Trojan horses, and
  viruses are network deliverable as E-mail, Java applets, ActiveX
  controls, JavaScripted pages, CGI-BIN scripts, or as
  self-extracting packages.</p>

  <p>Integrated mail systems such as Microsoft Outlook make it very
  simple to send not only a quick note edited within a limited text
  editor but also previously composed computer documents of
  arbitrary complexity to anyone, and to work with objects that you
  receive via standards such as MIME. They also support application
  programming interfaces (such as MAPI) that allow programs to send
  and process mail automatically. Well over 500 million E-mail
  messages are delivered daily in July 2000.</p>

  <p>Mobile-program systems are becoming more and more widespread.
  The most widely-hyped examples today are Java and ActiveX. This
  technology became popular with Web servers and browsers, but it
  is now integrated (e.g., Java into Lotus Notes, and ActiveX into
  Outlook) mail systems. Both Java and ActiveX have been found to
  have security bugs.</p>

  <h2>Structure of Viruses</h2>

  <p>Here is a simple structure of a virus. In the infected binary,
  at a known byte location in the file, a virus inserts a signature
  byte used to determine if a potential carrier program has been
  previously infected.</p>
  <pre>
V()
{
  infectExecutable();
  if (triggered()) {
    doDamage();
  }
  jump to main of infected program;
}

void infectExecutable()
{
 file = chose an uninfected executable file;
 prepend V to file;
}

void doDamage() {
   ...
}

int triggered()
{
  return (some test? 1 : 0);
}
</pre>

  <p>The above virus makes the infected file longer than it was,
  making it easy to spot. There are many techniques to leave the
  file length and even a check sum unchanged and yet infect. For
  example, many executable files often contain long sequences of
  zero bytes, which can be replaced by the virus and re-generated.
  It is also possible to compress the original executable code like
  the typical Zip programs do, and uncompress before execution and
  pad with bytes so that the check sum comes out to be what it
  was.</p>

  <h2>Virus Detection</h2>

  <p>Known viruses are by far the most common security problem on
  modern computer systems. Several web sites maintain complete
  lists of known viruses. There are thousands. Visit, e.g.,
  <a href="http://www.cai.com/virusinfo/encyclopedia/">www.cai.com/
  virusinfo/ encyclopedia/</a>. In the month of July 2000, there
  were 200+ "PC Viruses in the Wild" (<a href=
  "http://www.wildlist.org/">www. wildlist. org</a>). Virus
  detection programs analyze a suspect program for the presence of
  known viruses.</p>

  <p>Fred Cohen has proven mathematically that perfect detection of
  unknown viruses is impossible: no program can look at other
  programs and say either "a virus is present" or "no virus is
  present", and always be correct. But, in the real world, most new
  viruses are sufficiently like old viruses that the same sort of
  scanning that finds known viruses also finds the new ones. And
  there are a large number of heuristic tricks that anti-virus
  programs use to detect new viruses, based either on how they
  look, or what they do. These heuristics are only sometimes
  successful, but since brand-new viruses are comparatively rare,
  they are sufficient to the purpose.</p>

  <p>Virus scanners are sometimes classified by their "generation."
  The first generation virus scanners used previously obtained a
  virus signature, a bit pattern, to detect a known virus. They
  record and check the length of all executables. The second
  generation scans executables with heuristic rules, looking, e.g.,
  for fragments of code associated with a typical virus. They also
  do integrity checking by calculating a checksum of a program and
  storing somewhere else the encrypted checksum. The third
  generation use a memory resident program to monitor the execution
  behavior of programs to identify a virus by the types of action
  that the virus takes. The fourth Generation Virus Detection
  combines all previous approaches and includes access control
  capabilities.</p>

  <p>It is very educational to study the details of a scanner. The
  paper by Sandeep Kumar, and Gene Spafford, "A Generic Virus
  Scanner in C++," Proceedings of the 8th Computer Security
  Applications Conference, IEEEPress, Piscataway, NJ; pp.210-219,
  2-4 Dec 1992 [<a href="virusScanner.pdf">Local copy .pdf</a>] is

  <h1>2. <a name="Worms" id="Worms">Worms</a></h1>A <i>worm</i> is a
  malicious program that copies itself from one computer to another on
  a network. A worm is an independent program, in the sense described
  above, unlike a virus which is a part-program that must insert
  itself into a whole-program. A worm typically does not modify other
  programs. A typical worm may carry other code, including programs
  and viruses.  We describe just two famous worms.

  <h2>The Morris Internet worm of 1988</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm"> Morris
    worm</a> has been extensively analyzed as it was perhaps the first
    worm to use Internet to spread out.  Of course, the Internet of
    1988 was only few thousand nodes.  Robert Tappan Morris was
    convicted and sentenced to three years of probation, 400 hours of
    community service, a fine of $10,050, etc.
</p>

  <h2>StuxNet Worm</h2>

  <p>Popular media often labelled the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"> StuxNet</a> of
    2010 as a virus, but it is a worm.  There is a
    <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ralph_langner_cracking_stuxnet_a_21st_century_cyberweapon.html">
TED talk</a> (Ralph Langner, "Cracking Stuxnet, a 21st-Century Cyber
