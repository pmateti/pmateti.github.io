   [[./cryptolocker-2013.jpg]] ... An employee received an e-mail purporting
   to come from Intuit.  Attached zip with an executable. When the
   receiver clicked on it, he saw a white box flash briefly on his
   screen but didn't notice anything else out of the ordinary. ... By
   the time CryptoLocker had run its course, hundreds of gigabytes
   worth of company data was no longer available.

1. Asks for money is the least interesting part.  How did it encrypt?
   Did it send the file to a remote system, encrypt it there, and
   receive the result, replace the original file with the received
   file?  All this is doable by an ordinary user.  Did it do it on the
   local (compromised) machine?

1. http://bitcoin.org/ Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a
   new kind of money.  Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
   with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the
   issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the
   network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns
   or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its
   unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be
   covered by any previous payment system.

1. Ukash is eMoney. You treat it exactly like cash but spend it
   online. Perfect if you don’t have a credit or debit card or don’t
   want to use your card to pay online.

1. A web page can have Java applets and JavaScript. Although modern
   browsers sandbox JavaScript so it can only do file operations in
   /tmp, JavaScript can still take advantage of actual vulnerabilities
   within the browser itself.
