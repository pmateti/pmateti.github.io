<h1>Security Fortification</h1>

<h3><a href="http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti">Prabhaker Mateti</a></h3>

<blockquote><p> Abstract: This lecture is about adding a layer of
    protection beyond proper configuration of the OS and applications.
    This layer of protection consists of tools that help detect changes in
    the system and monitor (suspicious) system activity.  Fortification is
    the addition of packages to improve security.  It should be done after
    a system has been properly configured with the supplied components.
    Fortification frequently will discard a supplied component in
    preference to a carefully chosen added component.  Some what rarely,
    fortification involves deletion of components.

<h1>Security Fortification</h1>

<p>
  Fortification is the addition of packages to improve security.  It
  should be done after a system has been properly configured with the
  supplied components.  Fortification frequently will discard a supplied
  component in preference to a carefully chosen added component.  Some
  what rarely, fortification involves deletion of components.  In our
  discussion, we will postpone certain &quot;fortification&quot; items
  as &quot;hardening&quot; items even though we cannot offer a rigorous
  definition regarding the use of these two terms.</p>

<h2>Malware Detection</h2>

<h3>Virus Scanners</h3>
<p>
Of the many fortification suggestions made in this lecture, virus 
scanners are probably the most universally experienced item.  Windows-based 
virus scanners do focus on detecting not only viruses but also Trojans and root 
kits and are often also integrity checkers.</p>

<h3>Root Kit Detection</h3>

<p>Loadable kernel modules (LKM) bring run-time modularity to
  Linux. Device drivers and their modules are loaded only when
  necessary keeping the core kernel small. On the negative side, LKM
  rootkits are the easiest and most “elegant” way to modify the
  running kernel. In a modularized kernel the attacker can insert
  rootkits into kernel once he gains root privileges.  Through LKM
  rootkit the attacker can modify any part of the kernel. Typically
  LKM rootkits would redirect the system calls to the attacker’s own
  implementation.</p>

<p> The character device <tt>/dev/kmem</tt> is an image of the kernels
  virtual memory. Through this device, an attacker can modify the
  kernels text or data, and can drastically change the behavior of
  kernel. Other memory devices which can similarly be exploited are
  /dev/mem and /dev/port which give direct access to physical memory
  of the system.
</p>

<p>
Unless a file system auditor is in place, it is not
easy to spot the root kits after their installation.  The time to
be alert is when the root kits are being installed. </p>

<pre>apt-get install chkrootkit rkhunter unhide</pre>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<h3>User Authentication</h3>
<h3>Host Authentication</h3>
<h3>Service Authentication</h3>

<p>Look up Kerberos.</p>

<p>Read
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication</a></p>

<pre>apt-get install munge otp john</pre>

<p>"A process creates a credential by requesting one from the local
MUNGE service.  The encoded credential contains the UID and GID
of the originating process.  This process sends the credential to
another process within the security realm as a means of proving its
identity.  The receiving process validates the credential with the
use of its local MUNGE service.  The decoded credential provides
the receiving process with a reliable means of ascertaining the
UID and GID of the originating process, and this information can
be used for accounting or access control decisions."</p>

<p>otp == One Time Passwords</p>


<h2>Audit</h2>

<p>
Capture the output of <tt>ps aux</tt> and examine all processes
periodically.  The exact list will depend on the (Linux)
distribution. However, from one session to another, the first few are
not expected to have different process ids. The remainder may get
higher or lower pids depending on what is included in the boot up
scripts. However, once the boot scripts have stabilized you must make
a note of all process ids, and expect them to remain unchanged until
the scripts change again. </p>

<p>
You should also check that all processes owned by user &quot;nobody&quot; are 
running programs explicitly identified as legitimate for untrusted, 
unverified, remote users.  Each process belonging to a non-root 
system user is explicitly identified as legitimate for that user in 
this environment.
</p>

<h3>File System Audit</h3>

<p>
Intruders often replace binaries with their own Trojan versions.  
Many system administrators relied on time-stamping and check sum the 
files to determine when a binary file has been modified. But it is 
fairly simple to recreate the same time-stamp for the Trojan file as 
the original file. For example, if your standard <tt>touch</tt> 
does not do <tt>touch -r /bin/login</tt> develop a <tt>touch</tt> 
program that does it.  Or, by setting the system clock time back 
to the original file's time and then adjusting the Trojan file's time 
to the system clock. Once the binary Trojan file has the exact same 
time as the original, the system clock is reset to the current time. 
Simple check sum programs rely on a CRC checksum and are easily 
spoofed.  MD5 check sums are based on an algorithm that no one 
has yet spoofed.  This technology is behind the well known 
Tripwire.</p>

<pre>apt-get install tripwire systraq</pre>

<p>
Systraq daily consists of few very small shell scripts
that warn when system files change.
</p>

<h3>Activity Monitors</h3>

<p>
A few open-source activity monitoring programs (including intrusion
detection/prevention tools) are described below.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.snort.org/"> snort/</a> can be used as a packet
sniffer like tcpdump, a packet logger, or as a network intrusion
prevention/detection system.  Its rule-based system can detect buffer
overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB probes, OS
fingerprinting attempts, etc.
</p>

<p>Firewalls: iptables and some GUI frontend are standard in Linux
distributions.  Consider installing shorewall and webmin.
</p>

<p><tt>apt-get install tiger</tt> "is a set of Bourne shell scripts, C
programs and data files which are used to perform a security audit of
unix/Linux systems."
</p>

<p>xinetd: "xinetd has access control mechanisms, extensive logging
  capabilities, the ability to make services available based on time,
  and can place limits on the number of servers that can be started,
  among other things.  It has the ability to redirect TCP streams to a
  remote host and port.  This is useful for those of that use IP
  masquerading, or NAT, and want to be able to reach your internal
  hosts.  It also has the ability to bind specific services to
  specific interfaces.  This is useful when you want to make services
  available for your internal network, but not the rest of the
  world. Or to have a different service running on the same port, but
  different interfaces."
</p>
<p>
TCP Wrapper: When a potentially insecure service must be run,
tcp_wrappers should be utilized to &quot;wrap&quot; it. The wrapper
software does more detailed logging and better access control checking
by &quot;wrapping&quot; itself around the normal network daemons
configured in <i> inetd.conf</i>.  The <tt>tcpd</tt> used in
Linux is a new version of the TCP wrapper.</p>

<p>
ifstatus is a standalone program to check for 
promiscuous interfaces available from
<a href="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/ifstatus">
ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/ifstatus</a> </p><p>
dtk or &quot;Deception Toolkit&quot; is a kit of fake daemons and services 
designed to waste an intruders time. dtk is available from
<a href="http://all.net/dtk/example.html">all.net/dtk/example.html</a></p>
<p>
Bastille Linux is a series of scripts which tighten up security on stock Linux 
systems, by changing permissions and disabling features.</p>
<p>
Network Information Service (NIS) has been source of many weaknesses. 
Using Rsync + SSH as a replacement for NIS is often better.</p>
<p>
Logs produced by the<tt> kerneld, syslogd, tcpd,</tt> and the 
various services can become so large that it is humanly impossible to 
scan them for spotting suspicious activity and take a more serious 
look.  A few well known log analyzers are listed below.</p>

<ol>
  <li>sagan, Real-time syslog Monitoring System</li>
  <li>wwwstat, HTTPd Log file Analysis Software.</li>
  <li>Analog, Web server log file analyzer </li>
  <li>freq, A lastlog analyzer.</li>
  <li>tcpdstats, tcpd log analyzer.
  <li><tt>apt-get install god</tt> "God is an easy to configure, easy
    to extend monitoring framework written in Ruby."
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Improved Kernels</h2>

<p>The kernels supplied in various distributions are generic and 
security-wise permissive.  It is possible to recompile the kernel using the 
same source code as used by the distributor but with different selection of 
components and including them in the vmlinuz binary instead of as a dynamically 
loadable module.</p>
<h3>POSIX capabilities</h3>

  <p>POSIX capabilities (Pcaps) can turn a setuid-root file into a
    file with minimum privileges, run a daemon with uid=0 but with
    amost no superuser privileges, etc.  Privileges are granted to
    processes instead of users.  Pcaps are implemented in Linux
    kernels since 2.6.x; capsh, getpcaps, getcap, setcap are some of
    the tools.  Pcaps divide privileges that are typically granted to
    root user.  </p>

  <p>The table below presents PCaps for a few typical suid-root
  binaries.  The CAP-names used are defined in
  /usr/include/linux/capability.h.

<table>
<tr><td>ping</td><td>CAP_NET_RAW (13)</td></tr>
<tr><td>traceroute</td><td>CAP_NET_RAW (13)</td></tr>
<tr><td>chsh</td><td>CAP_CHOWN (0), CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH (2), CAP_FSETID (4), CAP_SETUID (7)</td></tr>
<tr><td>chfn</td><td>CAP_CHOWN (0), CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH (2), CAP_FSETID (4), CAP_SETUID (7)</td></tr>
<tr><td>chage</td><td>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH (2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>passwd</td><td>CAP_CHOWN (0), CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (1), CAP_FOWNER (3)</td></tr>
<tr><td>mount</td><td>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (1), CAP_SYS_ADMIN (21)</td></tr>
<tr><td>umount</td><td>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (1), CAP_SYS_ADMIN (21)</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>To change, run <tt>chmod u-s /usr/bin/chsh; setcap
  0,2,4,7=ep /usr/bin/chsh</tt>
