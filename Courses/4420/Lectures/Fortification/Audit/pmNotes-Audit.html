a very common piece of software which runs many blogs on the web. You
will use a tool called Metasploit (http://www.metasploit.com/ ) to

 perception has anything to do with free vs. expensive.

Metasploit is maturing nicely, its loudest proponents perhaps less so.

It seems Metasploit's most vocal proponents are seen as young and
inexperienced or even perhaps uncouth or lacking in professional
experience.  There is a perception that they are all high school and
college kids blabbering about how cool Metasploit is or how well
Metasploit works against XYX in a microcosm.

Metasploit is simply one very useful tool in the Kit. Keep in mind the
tools you use should change depending on the target and the intended
outcome.  }
