* Overview

Abstract: Auditing the security of an individual host and LAN is a
necessary activity.  This lecture describes the components of a
security policy and how to set up a platform for conducting this
audit, and the typical structure of a final report.

* Lab Experiment

1. https://dirtycow.ninja/ Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) is a privilege
   escalation vulnerability in the Linux Kernel

1. https://github.com/oleg-fiksel/ansible_CVE-2016-5195_check Playbook
   for testing the Dirty Cow vulnerability (CVE-2016-5195).

1. https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester 2016+ Often a
   security analyst needs to identify privilege escalation attack
   vectors.  One of viable attack vectors is using publicly known
   Linux exploit to gain root privileges.  Of course
   in order to do that the analyst needs to identify the right PoC
   exploit, make sure that his target is affected by the associated
   vulnerability and finally modify the exploit to suit his
   target. The =linux-exploit-suggester.sh= tool is designed to help
   with these activities.

1. https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-1000200/ The Linux Kernel
   versions 4.14, 4.15, and 4.16 has a null pointer dereference which
   can result in an out of memory (OOM) killing of large mlocked
   processes. The issue arises from an oom killed process's final
   thread calling exit_mmap(), which calls munlock_vma_pages_all() for
   mlocked vmas.This can happen synchronously with the oom reaper's
   unmap_page_range() since the vma's VM_LOCKED bit is cleared before
   munlocking (to determine if any other vmas share the memory and are
   mlocked). Publish Date : 2018-06-05 Last Update Date : 2018-08-29
