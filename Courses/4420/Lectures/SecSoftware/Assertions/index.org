   invariants, Floyd-Hoare Triplets, Pre- Post-Conditions.
1. [[./assertions-in-the-small.html]] Short programs with assertions
1. [[../Examples/tiny-examples.org]] Tiny Programming Examples with a Software Engineering Perspective
1. The [[./3np1.org][3n+1]] Termination Problem
1. [[./Java/assertions-java.org][Assertions in Java]]
1. [[./CPP/assertions-cpp.org][Assertions in C++]]
1. [[./practical-advice.org][Practical-Advice]] on Writing Assertions

* WP Calculus

* Java Modeling Language (JML)

1. http://www.openjml.org/
1. [[./JML/jml.org][JML]] Intro

* Tools for Assertions

1. http://frama-c.com/ "Frama-C is an extensible and collaborative
   platform dedicated to source-code analysis of C software." FOSS.

1. http://www.key-project.org/ "Integrated Deductive Software Design"
   For Java.  FOSS.

1. http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/ "The Checker
   Framework enhances Java's type system ...  detect and prevent
   errors ...  includes compiler plug-ins ("checkers") that find bugs
   or verify their absence."  FOSS. 2016

1. http://www.coverity.com/ Research from Stanford U.  Discovered
   1000+ bugs in Linux kernel.  Bought by https://www.synopsys.com/.
   Expensive to buy their service commercially.  "Coverity Scan is our
   free, cloud-based solution specifically for the Open Source
   Community."  Read https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity.html

1. 2018 All the above are actively being used and developed.

* Design by Contract

1. [[../OODesign/design-by-contract.org]]

1. [[../OODesign/meyer-design-by-contract-1992-markedUp.pdf]] Bertrand
   Meyer's full paper with marked up areas by me.
