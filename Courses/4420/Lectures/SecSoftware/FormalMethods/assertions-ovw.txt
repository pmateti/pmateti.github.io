Dr. Mateti,

Question on what you were looking for with regards to assertions and
invariants in the wiggly worms program:

Are we to actually implement these assertions/invariants as proper C++
code or were you simply looking for assertions in the comments?

For example, did you want something like:

#include <cassert>
#define MAXsegs 100
class Worm {
...
private int nsegs;
invariant (nsegs <= MAXsegs)

...
public setNsegs(int segs) {
   assert(segs <= MAXsegs);
   nsegs = segs;
}
}

or 

#define MAXsegs 100
class Worm {
...
private int nsegs; // nsegs <= MAXsegs
...
/* Sets the number of segments in a worm such that
    pre: segs <= MAXsegs
    post: nsegs <= MAXsegs */
public setNsegs(int segs) {
   nsegs = segs;
}
}
