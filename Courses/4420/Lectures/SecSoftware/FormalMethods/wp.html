<h2>Weakest Preconditions</h2>

<ol class=o>

<li>Let R stand for wp(S, Q).  R is an assertion/ predicate/ condition.
<p>For all states s that satisfy R, executing S on s guarantees that S
terminates, and the resulting state s' is such that s' staisfies Q.

<p>{wp(S, Q)} S {Q}<br>

<p>Note that wp() is about total correctness: It includes
termination.

<li><i>wp(S, False) = False</i> is impossible. True/False? Explain.

<p>
This is known as the Law of Excluded Miracle.  The phrase "is
impossible" apparently confuses some of you.  Understand it as "we
cannot do it" as in we cannot satisfy the precondition False and then
execute S.  So, for any Q, <i>wp(S, Q) = False</i> is impossible.


<li><i>wp(S, True ) = False</i> defines liveness of S.
	  True/False? Explain.
<p>
As stated above, it "is impossible".  But, what about
<i>wp(S, True ) = True</i>?  Dos this define liveness of S?


<li>Determine weakest
preconditions of the following. Show <i>all</i> intermediate steps. Assume
that all variables are of integer type.  PL code is shown enclosed in
braces.

<i><pre>
wp( {n := n + m; m := n + m; n := m - n},  (n == 6) and (m == 1) )</pre></i>


<pre class=sol>
= wp( {n := n + m; m := n + m}, (m - n == 6) and (m == 1) )
= wp( {n := n + m}, (n + m - n == 6) and (n + m == 1) )
= wp( {n := n + m}, (m == 6) and (n + m == 1) )
= (m == 6) and (n + m + m == 1)
= m == 6 and n == -11
</pre>

<i><pre>
wp( {if  i > j then i := i - j else j := i fi},  i == j )</pre></i>

<pre class=sol>
= (i > j => wp({i := i - j},i == j)) and (i <= j => wp({j := i}, i == j))
= (i > j => i - j == j) and (i <= j => i == i)
= (i > j => i == 2*j) and (i > j or true)
= (i <= j or i == 2*j) and (true)
= (i <= j or i == 2*j)
</pre>

<i><pre>
wp( {while i > 3 do i := i - 3 od},  i == 3 )</pre></i>

<pre class=sol>
P0 = (i <= 3) and (i == 3) = (i == 3)
P1 = (i > 3) and wp({i := i - 3}, i==3) = (i > 3) and (i-3 == 3) = (i == 6)
P2 = (i > 3) and wp({i := i - 3}, i==6) = (i > 3) and (i-3 == 6) = (i == 9)
Pk = i == 3*(k+1)

wp( {while i > 3 do i := i - 3 od},  i == 3 ) =  (P0 or &exist; k>= 0: Pk)
= (i == 3 or (&exist; k>= 0: i == 3*(k+1)))
= (&exist; k>= 1: i == 3*k)
= i == 3*k, for some k > 0
