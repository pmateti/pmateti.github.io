<h1>Practical Advice on Writing<br>
Pre- Post-Conditions for Real Programs</h1>
<h2>Prabhaker Mateti</h2>
<p>Examples:&nbsp; <a href="largenpp.c">large-numbers </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="worms12.c">wiggly-worms</a></p>
<p>The pre-condition is a logical formula. It should be written so that if we
&quot;evaluate&quot; it, the resulting value will be either the Boolean True or
False.</p>
<p>We use the word &quot;routine&quot; as a generic term for procedures and
functions. As you know, a function is a routine that has no side effects, and
returns a value to the caller. Functions, by this definition, do not alter the
values of any global variables, files, or arguments. Whereas the sole purpose of
a procedure is to have a side-effect.</p>
<h2>Signatures</h2>
<p>The signature of a routine, in a well-designed programming language, says
quite a bit in the sense of pre post conditions.</p>
<p>When you declare a formal parameter as a value parameter, you are saying that
its value at the end of the routine is by itself of no significance, and the
actual argument for it is unchanged. When you declare it as a <font
face="Lucida Console" size="2">var</font><font size="2"> </font>(or in-out)
parameter, you are saying that the routine is expected to change its value as
seen by the caller.</p>
<h2>Procedures and Functions that Alter Globals</h2>
<p>Procedures often alter global variables whose names are not passed in as
actual arguments. The heading of a procedure as declarable in the typical
programming language does not make clear which globals are accessed and/or
modified. The specifications of such procedures should list all such variables,
and describe their values before and after a call to the procedure. If the
variable name is <font face="Lucida Console" size="2">x</font>, we can use <font
face="Lucida Console" size="2">x0</font>, or <font face="Lucida Console"
size="2">old-x</font>, to stand for the value it had immediately upon entry into
the routine.</p>
<font face="Lucida Console">
<pre>   POST: 

	(old-X[i] == HEX[X[i]], for 0 &lt;= i &lt;= n-1)  &amp;&amp;

	(X[i] == 0, for N &lt;= i &lt;= ND) </pre>
</font>
<p>Frequently, we have a file that declares many globals. Not all of them are
manipulated by a routine. So, adopt the following convention. If a post
condition is silent regarding a global, we assume that it is actually asserting
that that global is-Unchanged by that routine. Some time a routine may not only
read but also actually update the value of global in between but finally leaves
its value as it was upon entry. In this case, silence is unacceptable, and we
should explicitly state that the global is unchanged.</p>
<h2>Robustness Tests</h2>
<p>Consider the following code:</p>
<font face="Lucida Console">
<pre>int f (T x) {

  int r;

  if (! bexp(x))

	return -1;

  ... more code ...

  ... r is defined so that r &gt;= 0...

  return r;

}</pre>
</font>
<p>This is typical of many functions. Some checking of the given value of <font
face="Lucida Console" size="2">x</font> is made. The function is checking its
precondition in order to improve its robustness. If it does not pass this test,
i.e., <font face="Lucida Console" size="2">bexp(x)</font><font size="2"> </font>is
false, the routine quits. This is often indicated to the caller by returning a
value that is outside the &quot;legit&quot; values, in this example a -1. In
other examples, you might see a <font face="Lucida Console" size="2">panic()</font><font
size="2"> </font>routine being called.</p>
<p>Q: Is <font face="Lucida Console" size="2">bexp(x) </font>a precondition of <font
face="Lucida Console" size="2">f()</font><font size="2"> </font>or not?<br>
A: It is a precondition.</p>
<h2>Some Useful Predicates</h2>
<p>We list some predicates that we can think of as being predefined. These are
useful in post conditions.</p>
<font face="Lucida Console" size="2">
<p>V is-defined</font><font size="2"> </font>asserts that a legitimate value
from the domain type of v has been assigned to the variable <font
face="Lucida Console">v</font> after its declaration. <font
face="Lucida Console" size="2">V is-undefined</font><font size="2"> </font>is
the same as <font face="Lucida Console" size="2">not (V is-defined).</p>
<p>V is-unchanged</font><font size="2"> </font>asserts that the variable v is
unchanged. That its value at the point of return is the same as it was at the
point of entry.</p>
<font face="Lucida Console" size="2">
<p>P is-malloc-returned</font><font size="2"> </font>asserts that the pointer
value stored in the variable <font face="Lucida Console">p</font> is a value
returned by the routine malloc. You can create many other similar predicates by
using the names of other functions in place of malloc.</p>
