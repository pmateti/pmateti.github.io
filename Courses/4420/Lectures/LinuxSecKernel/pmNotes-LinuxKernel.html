<p>Actually, x86 already does, but nobody uses these features. When they fixed 
segmentation with the 386, segments were now accessed through selectors and 
offsets. The selectors pointed to one of two tables (GDT - global descriptor 
table or LDT - local descriptor table). Whenever a memory access was made using 
a selector, the CPU would look up the descriptor corresponding to the selector. 
It would check whether the current program had necessary access rights and 
privilege. If not, then a GPF would be thrown. Segments can be marked as 
read-only, read-write, executable and maybe a few more combos. Although the GDT 
and LDT each have only room for 8192 entries, that's still probably more than 
most programs would need. Each segment could correspond to a single object or 
array of primitive objects. There would be no buffer overflows because the CPU 
catches attempts to go beyond the limit of a segment. Stack data couldn't be 
executed inadvertently because the stack segment would properly be marked as 
non-executable.<br>
<br>
There are a few reasons, though, why we don't use this system. One is that 
loading descriptors is slow because it was never optimized in the CPU with the 
equivalent of a TLB as for paging. The other is that using segmentation requires 
48-bit pointers rather than 32-bit pointers, or it requires loading segmentation 
registers and doing a dance with those. I suppose using longer pointers was a 
problem back in the days when memory was scarce, but it's hardly a problem now 
(check out 64-bit). Intel *could have* made segment descriptor access checks and 
loading fast, but I guess there wasn't a demand for it once paging was 
available. </p>

There are good reasons this facility isn't used for this purpose. Primarily, it 
was never designed for it. The descriptor tables are really supposed to be 
modified only by the OS -- allowing the application to modify them can cause 
severe problems. They're also a very scarce resource (you point out that there 
are only 8K of each type), and allocation constraints could be a problem. You 
certainly can't allocate every array in a large program like this, so you need 
to flag those where a buffer overflow might be a problem... at which point, it 
would probably be easier just to use something like a C++ object that emulates 
an array and performs bound checking. It would (in most circumstances) be as 
efficient, wouldn't require OS support, wouldn't be platform dependent, and 
would be just as easy for the programmer to do.<br>
<br>
The problem is that most programmers believe that their buffers are safe, 
because they've thought about possible overflow scenarios, and none look like 
they can work. So nothing would end up being written to use the protection. </p>

Guru Medication Error Redux Posted on 26 Feb 2002 by drobbins Hiya<br>
Slashdotters! From the Slashdot comments related to the original &quot;Guru<br>
Meditation Error -- missing patches?&quot; news item, I see that many of<br>
you still doubt that this missing patch problem actually exists. Fair<br>
enough. After all, what exactly was fixed by that bootmem patch<br>
mentioned previously? In a Slashdot post, Alan Cox contends that the<br>
patch was submitted by MandrakeSoft, but couldn't be proved to be<br>
correct so it was not applied. Yet in Mandrake's own SRPM, the bootmem<br>
patch has a one line comment that reads Fix an off by one error that<br>
results in memory overwrites. Now, I would contend that MandrakeSoft<br>
isn't simply adding this patch to their kernel for the thrill of it,<br>
but it is in fact doing it to fix a problem encountered in the<br>
field. After all, they took the time out of their busy lives to track<br>
down the problem and create a patch for it in the first place. Why<br>
patch what isn't broken? But in all honesty, I don't know; since I'm<br>
not in contact with the kernel developers at MandrakeSoft, I'm not one<br>
to say.<br>

ABSTRACT <br>
The Logical Coprocessing Kernel (LOCK) began as a research project to stretch 
the state of the art in secure computing by trying to meet or even exceed the 
“A1” requirements of the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC). 
Over the span os seven years, the project was transformed into an effort to 
develop and deploy a product: the Standard Mail Guard (SMG). Since the project 
took place under a US government contract, the development team needed to 
maintain detailed records of the time spent on the project. The records from 
1987 to 1992 have been combined with information about software code size and 
error detection. This information has been used to examine the practical impacts 
of high assurance techniques on a large-scale software development program. 
Tasks are associated with the A1 formal assurance requirements added 
approximately 58% to the development cost of security-critical software. In 
exchange for these costs, the formal assurance tasks (formal specifications, 
proofs, and specification code correspondence) uncovered 68% of the security 
flaws detected in LOCK's critical security mechanisms. However, a study of flaw 
detection during the SMG program found that only 14% of all flaws detected were 
of the type that could be detected using formal assurance, and that the work of 
the formal assusrance team only accounted for 19% of all flaws detected. While 
formal assurance is clearly effective at detecting flaws, its practicality 
hinges on the degree to which the formally modeled system properties represent 
all of a system's esential properties. <br>

ABSTRACT <br>
In many real-world applications, sensitive information must be kept it log files 
on an untrusted machine. In the event that an attacker captures this machine, we 
would like to guarantee that he will gain little or no information from the log 
files and to limit his ability to corrupt the log files. We describe a 
computationally cheap method for making all log entries generated prior to the 
logging machine's compromise impossible for the attacker to read, and also 
impossible to modify or destroy undetectably. <br>

ABSTRACT <br>
In role-based access control (RBAC), permissions are associated with roles' and 
users are made members of roles, thereby acquiring the roles; permissions. 
RBAC's motivation is to simplify administration of authorizations. An appealing 
possibility is to use RBAC itself to manage RBAC, to further provide 
administrative convenience and scalability, especially in decentralizing 
administrative authority, responsibility, and chores. This paper describes the 
motivation, intuition, and formal definition of a new role-based model for RBAC 
administration. This model is called ARBAC97 (administrative RBAC '97) and has 
three components: URA97 (user-role assignment '97), RPA97 (permission-role 
assignment '97), and RRA97 (role-role assignment '97) dealing with different 
aspects of RBAC administration. URA97, PRA97, and an outline of RRA97 were 
defined in 1997, hence the designation given to the entire model. RRA97 was 
completed in 1998. ARBAC97 is described completely in this paper for the first 
time. We also discusses possible extensions of ARBAC97. <br>

Statically Detecting Likely Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities <br>
David Larochelle, University of Virginia, Department of Computer Science <br>
Abstract<br>
Buffer overflow attacks may be today’s single most important security threat. 
This paper presents a new approach to mitigating buffer overflow vulnerabilities 
by detecting likely vulnerabilities through an analysis of the program source 
code. Our approach exploits information provided in semantic comments and uses 
lightweight and efficient static analyses. This paper describes an 
implementation of our approach that extends the LCLint annotation-assisted 
static checking tool. Our tool is as fast as a compiler and nearly as easy to 
use. We present experience using our approach to detect buffer overflow 
vulnerabilities in two security-sensitive programs.<br>

FormatGuard: Automatic Protection From printf Format String Vulnerabilities <br>
Crispin Cowan, Matt Barringer, Steve Beattie, and Greg Kroah-Hartman, WireX 
Communications, Inc. <br>
Abstract<br>
In June 2000, a major new class of vulnerabilities called Òformat bugsÓ was 
discovered when an vulnerability in WU-FTP appeared that acted almost like a 
buffer over-flow, but wasnÕt. Since then, dozens of format string 
vulnerabilities have appeared. This paper describes the format bug problem, and 
presents FormatGuard: our proposed solution. FormatGuard is a small patch to 
glibc that provides general protection against format bugs. We show that 
FormatGuard is effective in protect-ing several real programs with format 
vulnerabilities against live exploits, and we show that FormatGuard imposes 
minimal compatibility and performance costs. <br>

Detecting Format String Vulnerabilities with Type Qualifiers <br>
Umesh Shankar, Kunal Talwar, Jeffrey S. Foster and David Wagner, University of 
California at Berkeley <br>
Abstract<br>
We present a new system for automatically detecting format string security 
vulnerabilities in C programs using a constraint-based type-inference engine. We 
describe new techniques for presenting the results of such an analysis to the 
user in a form that makes bugs easier to find and to fix. The system has been 
implemented and tested on several real-world software packages. Our tests show 
that the system is very effective, detecting several bugs previously unknown to 
the authors and exhibiting a low rate of false positives in almost all cases. 
Many of our techniques are applicable to additional classes of security 
vulnerabilities, as well as other type- and constraint-based systems. <br>

Intrusion detection using sequences of system calls <br>

Abstract: <br>
<br>
<br>
A method is introduced for detecting intrusions at the level of privileged 
processes. Evidence is given that short sequences of system calls executed by 
running processes are a good discriminator between normal and abnormal operating 
characteristics of several common UNIX programs. Normal behavior is collected in 
two ways: Synthetically, by exercising as many normal modes of usage of a 
program as possible, and in a live user environment by tracing the actual 
execution of the program. In the former case several types of intrusive behavior 
were studied; in the latter case, results were analyzed for false positives.<br>

Abstract: <br>
<br>
<br>
In recent years, a method for analyzing security protocols using the process 
algebra CSP (Hoare, 1985) and its model checker FDR (Roscoe, 1994) has been 
developed. This technique has proved remarkably successful, and has been used to 
discover a number of attacks upon protocols. However, the technique has required 
producing a CSP description of the protocol by hand; this has proved tedious and 
error-prone. In this paper we describe Casper, a program that automatically 
produces the CSP description from a more abstract description, thus greatly 
simplifying the modelling and analysis process.<br>

Web server attacks have doubled over the course of the last year, despite 
increased spending on security. <br>
<br>
<br>
That's the main conclusion of a survey of more than 2,500 organisations, 
sponsored by security firms TruSecure and Predictive Systems. The survey found 
that almost half those quizzed (48 per cent) had suffered a Web server attack in 
2001, against 24 per cent in 2000. Viruses, worms, Trojans and other malware 
infected 90 percent of the respondents to the survey, even though 88 percent of 
those companies already had antivirus protection in place (which doesn't say a 
lot for AV software, but we digress). <br>
<br>
Although security spending continues to grow, the survey threw up the 
interesting finding that a third of surveyed companies froze spending during the 
course of this year due to the general economic malaise we're all living 
through. <br>
<br>
Corporate funding for infosecurity continues to grow overall, though the pace 
has slowed from that of recent years. Nearly one-third (29 per cent) of surveyed 
companies froze security spending sometime in 2001 due to adverse economic 
conditions. <br>
<br>
Disgruntled company insiders remain far more a security threat than hackers and 
s'kiddiots but security the edge of corporate networks (through firewalls, VPNs 
and the like) remains the number one priority for BOFHs. <br>
<br>
As far as directions in technology spending go, the survey concludes that 2002 
will be the year that Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology finally takes 
off, a prediction that we've heard for the last three years but is yet to come 
about. We're far more in agreement with the survey's finding that wireless and 
enterprise security management will be hot areas next year though. <br>
<br>
You can see the main findings of the survey, which were published in the October 
issue of Information Security magazine, here. <br>

blocks the ptrace() syscall for all users except root. This should effectively 
prevent local root from being gained via the latest series of ptrace() exploits.

The Sentinel project is designed to be a portable, accurate, and effective 
implementation of all publicly known promiscuous detection techniques. Sentinel 
currently supports 3 methods of remote promiscuous detection: The DNS test, icmp 
etherping test, and ARP test. Tested on OpenBSD-3.0beta, FreeBSD 4.0, Netbsd 
1.5.2, and Linux 2.4.x. Changes: Bug fixes, updated documentation. Homepage:

vma_rw_chk-1.0.tar.gz 2509 Oct 3 23:31:32 2001 <br>
Vma_rw_chk is a small security module for Linux-2.2.19 which prevents most 
exploits from working by wrapping execve() and checking to see that the caller 
does not call from a writable memory segment. Since most local (and many remote) 
exploits call execve() or similar from the stack (and environment, which is also 
placed on the stack), which is writable, it prevents most standard exploits from 
working. Homepage: http://www.energymech.net/users/proton. By Proton <br>

Legions is an organization of collective minds, all working toward a goal of 
better security. We do not exist to destroy anything. We merely discover flaws, 
and take measures to correct flaws. We do not create flaws. We are not 
destroyers. We are but perfecters in an imperfect world. Consider this. Your car 
goes through more safety inspections imaginable before it is sold to you. It is 
not required that your computing infrastructure undergoes any safety inspection. 
Wouldn't you like to have a recall notice every once in awhile on your computing 
technology? <br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Who are we?<br>
We are a selected group of computer enthusiasts living around the world and 
sharing our ideas with others. <br>
<br>
What do we do?<br>
We do a wide variety of things mostly dealing with computers. We talk on irc 
about security, coffee, computer related stuff and general stupid shit. Also, we 
do networking, programming, and security audits aswell as other stuff. Basiclly, 
we are changing mankind for the better. <br>
<br>
Will we answer questions sent to us?<br>
<br>
If the members that you've mailed your questions to have enough time, they will 
answer them. Although if you send us a message along the lines of &quot;how do i hack 
hotmail&quot; or &quot;how do i deface a website&quot;, we will not answer because we have no 
time for such lame stuff. <br>
<br>
Can you join?<br>
Maybe. We do take on new members once in a while. All you have to do is come 
hang out on IRC for awhile and get to know everyone. It helps if you contribute 
to the ongoing projects, and to some of the numerous topics of discussion. <br>
<br>
Where do we hang out?<br>
Come and chat with us on IRC via server irc.undernet.org at channel #legions <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
We are but curious explorers. We are the new generation. Those that came before 
us fear us. They have labeled us Generation X, and Generation Y, as they could 
not figure us out. Our parents do not understand our true nature. It is an 
evolution of mind, born in a digital nursery and encouraged by those that either 
wished to help us, or those that wish to destroy us. We are the future. We have 
come to claim it. <br>
