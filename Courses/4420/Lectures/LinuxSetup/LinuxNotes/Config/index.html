  Objective</a>s</h2>

  <ol>

  <h1>Configuring a System Properly</h1>

  <p>There are two other lectures related to the current lecture:
    <a href="http://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/Fortification/"> Fortification</a> and
    <a href="http://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/HardenOS/">
      Hardening</a>.  It is important to understand the
    differentiation among these terms but perhaps too pedantic to try
    to rigorously distinguish between proper configuration from these
    two topics.  Systems as distributed and installed "out-of-the-box"
    are often loosely configured.  This may be due to sloppiness of
    the distributor.  More commonly it is because the distributor has
    tried to configure a generic appeal-to-all setup.  Proper
    configuration involves the examination of configuration settings
    of all installed software.  This is a prerequisite to fortifying
    and/or hardening.</p>

  <p>Proper configuration should happen immediately after a fresh
    install of the OS, and then after making changes to the system
    including adding or deleting services and user accounts.  It should
    be done on the host machine without network connections.  We ignore
    here the considerable amount of configuration tuning done to improve
    performance, reduce resource usage, and in general for cleanup.
  </p>

  <p>We focus on the security of Linux systems.  We only highlight
    what needs to be done leaving out the recipe-level
    descriptions to the references.  

  <h2>Proper Configuration of Security for Personal Machines</h2>

  <p>The Internet Domain Survey (
    <a href=https://www.isc.org/network/survey/>
    https://www.isc.org/network/survey/</a>) reports the number of
    hosts advertised in the DNS.  As of Jul 2017 it is 1 billion.
    Perhaps as many as 95% of these are personal machines, the rest
    being various servers. Perhaps 80% of these personal machines, and
    nearly 100% of those behind firewalls in private LANs, are running
    Windows 7/8/XP/.../10 and Linux with little supervision from
    trained system administrators, the remaining systems being other
    variants of Unix and Macintoshes.  These have become targets of
    script kiddies.</p>

  <h2>Files and Installed Software</h2>

  <p>Installing a new OS image has become a straightforward
    activity. Nearly all well-known Linux distributions and Windows can
    be installed by non-computer specialist by booting from a supplied
    DVD and answering a few questions. This activity is not the focus of
    this lecture. In the lab experiment, we have simplified the install
    problem further. There is a so-called "frugal install" which leaves
    most of a Linux distribution installed as a single large (in the GB)
    file that is an image of a compressed file system.  There is some
    performance loss as a result, but there is also greater assurance
    that the files within remain intact.</p>

  <p>The rest of the lecture highlights checks you should make after
    this initial phase of installing a new OS image, and associated
    applications.  Depending on the distribution, the path names cited below may be
    different.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Removing Unnecessary Software Packages
    <li>Patching Linux Systems
    <li>Checking File Permissions and Ownership.  Examine all the
      files in the standard directories: <tt>/, /bin, /boot, /dev,
        /etc, /root, /sbin, /usr, /usr/bin,</tt>
      and <tt>/usr/sbin.</tt>  These should all be owned by root and
      not writeable to others.  The <tt>/tmp</tt> and </var/tmp> are
world-writeable.  The file <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> is
world-readable for legacy reasons, but <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>
should be world-unreadable.
<li>SUID executables: Examine every suid root file.  <tt>find / -type f \( -perm
    -004000 -o -perm -002000 \) -exec ls -lg {} \;</tt> will list all
  the SUID/SGID files.  Verify that every such binary or script needs
  to be set-user-id-ed. Setuid scripts are very vulnerable.  If POSIX 
  capabilities are enabled, suid root permission can be removed.
<li>Securing Postfix, Sendmail
<li>Securing NFS
<li>Securing SSH
<li>Copying Files Using SSH Without Providing Login Prompts
<li>Checking Accounts.

Strong Password Policy.
Use tools such as "John the ripper" to find out weak users passwords on your server. Configure pam_cracklib.so to enforce the password policy.

Linux: Force Users To Change Their Passwords Upon First Login
Linux turn On / Off password expiration / aging
Lock the user password
Search for all account without password and lock them
Use Linux groups to enhance security

Under Linux you can use the faillog command to display faillog records or to set login failure limits. faillog formats the contents of the failure log from /var/log/faillog database / log file. It also can be used for maintains failure counters and limits.

Only root account have UID 0 with full permissions to access the system.  Enable Password Aging.  Restrict Use of Previous Passwords.  Lock User Accounts After Too Many Login Failures.
	<li>Restricting Direct Login Access for System and Shared Accounts
	<li>Restricting su Access to System and Shared Accounts
  </ol>

  <h2>Booting Sequence</h2>

  <p>Booting time is an excellent point where an attacker can install
    Trojans.  Examine the booting sequence to verify that the kernel
    and other executables are what they claim to be. <tt> </tt>Also,
    compare the MD5 sums of the executables after each boot with those
    you saved immediately after fresh install.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Reviewing inittab and Boot Scripts
	<li>Disabling Unneeded Services:  See below.
	<li>Configuring Services
<li>Closing Network Ports and Disabling Runlevel System Services
<li>Closing Network Ports and Disabling Xinetd Services
  </ol>

  <h3>Disabling Unneeded Services</h3>

  <p>Exposed machines should run as few programs as possible;
  the ones that are run should be as small as possible.

  <p>Services are started in exactly three ways:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>During boot time via a script. This is traceable from
    <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> and <tt>/etc/init.d/*</tt>.

    <li>As a result of network connection. This is traceable from
    <tt>/etc/inetd.conf.</tt>

    <li>Explicitly as a command.
  </ol>

  <p>In all cases, only install the <b>absolutely necessary</b>
  services. If you are not sure what it is, <i>disable</i> it.
  These services (listed alphabetically) are commonly left running
  in improperly configured Unix/ Linux distributions. In the
  following, "wrapping" a service refers to initiating the service
  through a wrapper program that does extra checking and logging
  before invoking the original program that provides the service.
  Two well known wrappers are <tt>tcpwrapper</tt> and
  <tt>tcpd</tt>.</p>

  <p>Most, but not all, Linux systems now use <tt>xinetd</tt> instead
  of <tt>inetd</tt>. The configuration files for xinetd are
  "distributed" into <tt>/etc/xinetd.conf</tt> and into files located
  in the subdirectory <tt>/etc/xinetd.d/</tt> All references below to
  <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt> should be understood as including
  these if xinetd is in use.</p>

  <p><b>bootp, bootps</b> : Used for bootp services.</p>

  <p><b>echo, daytime, discard, chargen</b>: These services are
  used largely for testing and are largely unnecessary.</p>

  <p><b>exec</b>: Allow remote users to execute commands on a host
  without needing to log in. It exposes remote user passwords on
  the network, thus is highly insecure. We recommend disabling the
  service.</p>

  <p><b>finger</b>: allows remote users to use the <i>finger</i>
  utility to obtain information about arbitrary users on a host.
  Considered highly insecure. We recommend disabling the service or
  using a more secure version such as cfinger.</p>

  <p><b>ftp</b> : allows remote users to transfer files to/from a
  host using <i>ftp</i>. Since user passwords are easily sniffable
  (they are transmitted over the wire in clear text), we recommend
  disabling the service and using instead a secure file transfer
  mechanism which encrypts the entire session (such as Kerberized
  ftpd or SSH). If ftp access is a must, the service should be
  wrapped.</p>

  <p>"filez" transfers: If you allow files to both be written to
  and read from by anonymous FTP users, attackers will find those
  accounts and use them to transfer "warez", MP3 files, and
  porn.</p>

  <p><b>login</b>: Allows remote users to use the Berkeley
  <i>rlogin</i> utility to log in to a host without supplying a
  password (via the <tt>.rhosts</tt> mechanism). Use SSH
  instead. If rlogin access is a must, the service should be
  wrapped.</p>

  <p><b>netstat</b> : Designed to provide network status
  information about a host to remote hosts.</p>

  <p><b>shell</b> : See login above.</p>

  <p><b>smtp</b> If you allow the "relay" feature on SMTP servers,
  spammers will find your server and use it to forward spam through
  (to hide themselves and also take advantage of your higher-speed
  connection).</p>

  <p><b>systat</b> : designed to provide status information about a
  host.</p>

  <p><b>smurf amplifiers</b> If you do not adjust your subnet masks
  and visible services, attackers will attempt to use your site as
  a "smurf" or "fraggle" amplifier to flood other victims on the
  net.</p>

  <p><b>website defaults</b> If you put a web server on the
  Internet, you must carefully remove all "defaults", "samples",
  and "CGI scripts" or attackers will at minimum deface web pages
  or compromise the machine.</p>

  <p><b>telnet</b> : Allows remote users to connect to a host via
  <i>telnet</i>. which transmits user passwords over the wire in plain
  text and can therefore be easily sniffed. Use ssh instead.  If
  telnet access is a must, the service should be "TCP-wrapped".</p>

  <p><b>talk, ntalk</b> : allows remote users to use <i>talk</i> to
  have a real time conversation with a user on a host.</p>

  <p><b>tftp</b> : allows remote users to transfer files from a
  host without requiring login. Used primarily by X-terminals and
  routers. If tftp access is desired, the service be wrapped.</p>

  <p><b>time</b>: Used for clock synchronization. We recommend
  disabling the service and using <i>xntp</i> to synchronize your
  system clock to WWV.</p>

  <p><b>uucp</b> : allows remote users to transfer files to/from a
  host using the UUCP protocol. Unless you use UUCP, we recommend
  disabling the service.</p>

  <h3><b>RPC</b> based services</h3>

  <p><b>RPC</b> based services such as NFS and NIS are a major
  security hazards unless you are using secure RPC. Our general
  recommendation is therefore against the use of NIS or NFS unless
  the physical network segments are protected either physically or
  via the use of switched hubs. All RPC based services should be
  disabled in <i>inetd.conf</i> (unless NFS/NIS must be used).</p>

  <p>Alternatives to NIS are: the use of Sun Microsystem's NIS+,
  and the use of <i>rsync</i> along with SSH to distribute
  <i>/etc/passwd</i>, <i>/etc/group</i>, etc. to clients from a
  central server.</p>

  <p>Common RPC based services defined in <i>inetd.conf</i>
  are:</p>

  <p><b>rexd</b> : allows remote users to run RPC programs on a
  host. Can be used to run an arbitrary shell on the host, thus
  highly insecure. We recommend disabling the service.</p>

  <p><b>rquotad</b> : returns quotas for a user of a local file
  system which is mounted by a remote machine over the NFS. We
  recommend disabling it.</p>

  <p><b>rstatd</b> : extracts performance statistics from the
  kernel for use by programs such as perfmeter. We recommend
  disabling it.</p>

  <p><b>ruserd</b> : is used to return a list of users on a
  network. We recommend disabling it.</p>

  <p><b>sprayd</b> : records the packets sent by spray, and sends a
  response to the originator of the packets. We recommend disabling
  it.</p>

  <p><b>walld</b> : used for handling rwall and shutdown requests.
  We recommend disabling it.</p>

  <p><b>ypupdated</b> : used for updating NIS information. Since we
  recommend against the use of NIS in general, this service should
  be disabled.</p>

  <h2>Monitoring a Running System</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Protecting the root Account  Even on a personal machine, normal daily use of the system
  should be through a non-root account. The root must have a
  non-trivial password. Run a password audit tool to verify that
  the password is not weak.
	<li>Detecting Listening Network Ports
	<li>Restricting System Access from Servers and Networks
	<li>Kernel Tunable Security Parameters
	<li>/etc/sysctl.conf controls the system.
	<li>Preventing Accidental Denial of Service
	<li>Displaying Login Banners
	<li>Watch the log files. Minimally, files that should be examined are:
  <tt>/var/log/messages, /var/log/syslog.</tt>
  </ol>

  <h2>Shutdown Sequence</h2>

  <p>Shutdown time also is an excellent point where an attacker can
    install Trojans.  A clever attacker would have downloaded the
    needed files during the normal running, but would not have
    installed them until most of the system was shut down.
