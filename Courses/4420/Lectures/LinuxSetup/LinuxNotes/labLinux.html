    <p>A lab in this course expects you to learn security related
      issues on Linux.  In a Lab, you will not be expected to write
      new code -- in a Project, you will be.


      <h2>Background</h2>
  
    <p> This lab is to be done on "your own" (Linux) PC.  There are no
      lab facilities set aside especially for this course.

    <p> By the time this lab is due, we would have covered the
      essentials of (i) system calls, (ii) File Volumes and (iii)
      Process Management.
    <p>      
      You must follow the
      <a href=../LabReports/index.html>
        Lab Report Template</a>.

    <p>Submit a PDF file named *exactly* <code>Report-L1.pdf</code>.
      (Scripts are used to check various things -- so file names
      should obey "rules".)  There should be a section on each of the
      following taks.  Use good judgement and do not make the report
      way longer than, say, 20 pages.

    <h2>Learn Linux Commands/ SysCalls/ Libraries</h2>

    <p> Coming into the course, you are expected to be comfortable
        with Linux commands.  Recall that CEG2350 and CEG4350 are in
        the prerequisite chain.

    <ol>
      <li> Try all the commands of the <a href="./minUnixCmd.html">
          Minimal List of Unix Commands</a> [You cannot claim to be
          Linux-familiar unless you have used them all a few times.]
        <ol type=a>
          <li>
            Use script (read <code>man script</code>) to demonstrate
            that you invoked the commands, and to capture stdin +
            stdout.  If what you captured is way too long, trim it.
          <li>A few commands cannot be run unless you are superuser;
            for such commands, just capture its message.  Better yet,
            use <tt>sudo</tt>, but beware of consequences.
        </ol>
      <li>Explain what the command <br>
        <code> indent -kr -i2 -pmt *.C *.h</code> <br>
        does.  Include a description of the effect of the options <code>-kr
          -i2 -pmt.</code>  [The indent program may not be installed in
        the standard installation of your Linux distro.  On Kubuntu,
        install it using
        <code>apt install indent</code>]

      <li>
        Explain briefly in one or two lines what the following do.  
        <ol>
          <li> ltrace, strace
          <li> nm, size
          <li> ldd
        </ol>

      <li>The following  are standard library routines:<br>
        <code>fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, fstat, fscanf, fprintf,
          printf, sprintf</code><br>Look up their functionality in
          both the local and the on-line man pages.  Describe their
          functionality briefly, one sentence each, in <b>your own
          words</b>.  Do these use syscalls?  Which?

      <li>List the names of 5 standard library routines <i>other than
          the above</i>, and 5 corresponding system calls <i>used</i>
        by these.
    </ol>

    <h2>Studying Programs</h2>

    <p>The source code for a several tiny programs is given in the
      directory <a href=./StudyPrograms/> ./StudyPrograms</a>.  Study
      the source to see what syscalls and library calls they make, and
      how they are to be built, and the numerical relationships
      between the addresses of variable.

    <ol>
      <li>There is a Makefile included.  <code>make</code> will
        compile and link one program with no error messages.  It is
        using <code>CFLAGS = -g -Wall -ansi -pedantic</code> &nbsp;
        Explain what these flags cause <code>gcc</code> to do.  Expand
        the Makefile to become complete, so that all included programs
        in the directory are built properly.
      <li>What is a "Segmentation Fault"?
    </ol>

    <h2>Linux Limits</h2>

    <ol>
      <li> Submit explanations and code that verified your answers.
      <li>Assuming none other than you is on *your* system, how many
        processes can you have that are simultaneously alive? Read up on
        what is known as a "Fork Bomb".
      <li>Can you improve the <tt>recurse</tt> above so that it
        recurses more deeply?
      <li>
        What is the max amount of virtual memory can a Linux process
        have?
    </ol>

    <h2>Install Linux on a USBD</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Install on a USB drive a multi-boot Linux setup.  One
	        installation should be Knoppix and another Kali/BackTrack.
	        Use the latest versions.  You will need a USBD of at least 8
	        GB.  For details of how-to-do-it, you can vist the home page
	        of
        <a href="http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/2350/">
          CEG2350</a> and then click on the OS-on-USB Lab.  You can also visit
        <a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/">
        http://www.pendrivelinux.com/</a>, but this just gives you
        recipes without an explanation of how things work.

      <li>Verify that the USBD can boot a few different PC/Laptops
	      that you have access to.
    </ol>
