* John-the-Ripper

1. http://www.openwall.com/john/ "John the Ripper is a fast password
   cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix, Windows,
   DOS, and OpenVMS. Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix
   passwords." https://github.com/magnumripper/JohnTheRipper

1. Linux/Unix, Windows.  Command line.  =apt-get install john=
   Installs =john=, =unshadow=, etc.

   : sudo apt-get install john

1. http://www.openwall.com/john/doc full docs, including download
   links, etc.


** What Does It Do?

1. Suppose we have a file of salted and encoded passwords, such as
   /etc/shadow of Linux.  John can crack these into plain text.

1. Example Usage.  Can take hours/ days.

   : sudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/mypasswd.txt
   : john /tmp/mypasswd.txt

1. A log is produced as =~/.john/john.log= John prints a status line
   when a key is pressed.  It contains guesses, passwords cracked,
   time, etc.

1. Invoke the external module AutoStatus to enable automatic output of
   the status line every n-th guess.  External modules are custom
   functions called by john, and can be defined in john.conf; see
   below.

** Successful Example

1. =man john= Required Reading

** Example That Can Take Days


** How Does It Do?

1. http://blog.nullmode.com/blog/2015/03/22/36-core-aws-john/

1. Attempts (i) a dictionary attack, (ii) combined dictionary words,
   (iii) hybrid attack of dictionary words with special characters and
   numbers, (iv) brute force.

** john.conf

1. Configuration file.  This [[https://github.com/rafaveguim/jtr-lab-tools/blob/master/john.conf][john.conf]] is from the reference below.

1. TBD Unknown option: "--pot=rockyou_vs_bfield.pot"

#+begin_src bash
./john --wordlist=./rockyou.txt \
     --rules \
     --pot=rockyou_vs_bfield.pot \
     --conf=john.conf.txt \
     --external=AutoStatus \
     --format=Raw-MD5 \
     battlefield-hashes.txt 2> rockyou_vs_bfield.log
#+end_src
