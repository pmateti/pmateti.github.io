Abstract: This chapter is about how computer systems authenticate
users.  We focus on the password system of Linux in detail and that of
Windows briefly.  Cryptography forms the backbone of any password
system.  We sketch the password cracking procedures and describe  lab
experiments that use well-known cracking tools.

* Educational Objectives

Students should be able to
  
1. Recognize the limitations of the typical password schemes
1. Sketch the cracking algorithms, and use cracking tools

* User Authentication Approaches

1. Authentication of Users, Services, Servers, Documents, ...
1. User Authentication Approaches
   1. What You Know
   1. What You Have
   1. What You Are
1. Password Verification Services
1. One Time Password (OTP) Authentication
1. Two-Factor Authentication
1. Choosing good passwords; What are weak passwords?

* Linux Passwords Overview

1. Passwords, Hashing, Salting
1. Cryptography, MD5, SHA1 Digests
2. DES Encoding of Passwords
3. The Linux Password Shadow System
4. Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
1. [[./Linux/passwords-linux.org]] All the above

** Windows Passwords Overview

1. [[./Linux/passwords-windows.org]]

* Password Storage

1. Passwords are never stored as plain text.  Only the results of
   crypto hashes (and some more mangling known as "salting") are stored. 

1. [[./Linux/salted-hashes.org]] Intro to hash functions and salting.

1. There are only two ways to determine the un-encoded password p given
   the hash r:

1. Keep guessing a password p, compute chash(p) = r, until r is found
   in the table.
1. Create a list of "all" passwords (column 1) and their hashed
   results (column 2).  This is known as a "lookup table".  Such a
   table will be huge (based on the "all" passwords in your
   collection), but is very simple to use and is fast.  E.g., we can
   sort the lookup table based on column 2 and use binary search.
1. Note that every password storage depends on the chash() chosen.
