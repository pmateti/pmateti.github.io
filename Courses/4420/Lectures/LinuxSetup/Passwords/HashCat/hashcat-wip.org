* Hashcat

1. Hashcat is a "password recovery" utility, using CPUs, GPUs, and
   other hardware accelerators on Linux, Windows, and OSX.  Can do
   distributed password cracking.

1. As root: =apt install hashcat=.  This installs =/usr/bin/hashcat=,
   a manual page for hashcat, and several files in
   =/usr/share/hashcat/=.  Do this on your Linux machine.

1. A typical invocation is shown below.  Read the =man hashcat=.
   Learn the options and path name arguments in the following command,
   and prepare their content.  The token =time= is a bash prefix -- it
   gives a fairly accurate measure of the time taken by the rest of
   the command line.

   : time hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt

   1. Use [[./etc/hashes-md5.txt]] as hashes.txt.

   2. [[./etc/passwords-johny.txt]] is a copy of usr/ share/ john/
      password.lst.  Use it as wordlist.txt

** FAQ

1. https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=frequently_asked_questions

1. Hashcat has such an extensive wiki that it can be frustrating for
   casual users of hashcat.

1. Hashcat is a CLI-tool, but does not obey (modern) Linux rules.

1. Even after cracking the hashes, to get it to show the discovered
   passwords is non-trivial: Use the "--show" and "-o" option with
   your chosen file name, e.g., "output-fnm.txt".  For some reason,
   this -o file does not get created all the time.  Check the contents
   of % cat /usr/local/hashcat/hashcat.potfile
