<h2>Encryption and Hashes</h2>


<p>Passwords are stored encrypted with a one-way
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"
   target="_blank">hash</a> function, which maps a (very very large)
   domain ("plain text") into a small range of numbers.  Two famous
   hash functions are MD5 and SHA1.  This hash function is so
   carefully constructed that there is no "computationally feasible"
   algorithm that can be applied to the hash to determine the
   unencrypted password.  There are only two ways to determine the
   unencrypted password:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep trying passwords until you find the right one (brute force)</li>
<li>in advance, create a list of passwords and their encrypted results.  This is known as a lookup table.  Such a table can be huge, but is very simple to use and is fast.  Rainbow tables are a compromise.  They consume less space, but require more processing.  Compared with brute force, they still can be very fast (unless the password is poor and can be guessed immediately).</li>
</ul>

<p> To keep things simple, our example "plain texts" will be numbers
between 0 and 99.


<h2>Simple Hashes and&nbsp;Collisions</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/" target="_blank">Geoff
Kuenning</a>, a computer science professor at Harvey Mudd College, has
a
great <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/classes/hmc.cs070.200101/homework10/hashfuncs.html"
target="_blank"> web page about hashes</a> as a part of one of his
classes.  Let&#8217;s look at two of the three simple hash functions
he presents -- we&#8217;ll use one of these for our rainbow table.</p>

<p>When we look at the hash functions, one of the things we want to
consider is the number of <em>collisions</em> that occur.  Because the
domain of a hash function is very large compared to the range,
multiple input values get mapped to the same range value.  When this
  happens, it is known as a collision.

<h3>Hash Function 1: The Division Method</h3>

<p>The division method simply uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation" target="_blank">modulo</a> function:</p>
<pre>     <span style="color:#ff6600;">h </span>= <span style="color:#ff6600;">p </span>mod m</pre>

<p>where m is a prime number.

<p>Here is a table of hash values for plaintext values from 0-19, with a m == 13:</p>
<pre>    p  h      p  h      p  h      p  h
    0  0      5  5     10 10     15  2
    1  1      6  6     11 11     16  3
    2  2      7  7     12 12     17  4
    3  3      8  8     13  0     18  5
    4  4      9  9     14  1     19  6</pre>

There are collisions.

<h3>Hash Function 2: The Multiplication Method</h3>

<p>This hash function is a little more involved, but is still simple enough to implement easily in a spreadsheet.  Kuenning conveniently breaks it into three calculations.  This makes it easier to understand (and easier to program).</p>
<pre>     s = <span style="color:#ff6600;">p</span>*A
     x = fractional part of s
     <span style="color:#ff6600;">h </span>= floor(m*x)</pre>

<p>Below is a table of the results of this hash applied to the numbers
  0-19, with A set to 6.213335, m set to Kuenning&#8217;s recommended
  value of (SQRT(5) &#8211; 1)/2, and x truncated to 4 digits (if s =
1.234567, x is then 2345)</p><pre>
p   s              x       h            p  s              x       h
0   0              0    0000           10  62.13335    1333    0823
1   6.213335    2133    1318           11  68.346685   3466    2142
2   12.42667    4266    2636           12  74.56002    5600    3460
3   18.640005   6400    3955           13  80.773355   7733    4779
4   24.85334    8533    5273           14  86.98669    9866    6097
5   31.066675    666    0411           15  93.200025   2000    1236
6   37.28001    2800    1730           16  99.41336    4133    2554
7   43.493345   4933    3048           17  105.626695  6266    3872
8   49.70668    7066    4367           18  111.84003   8400    5191
9   55.920015   9200    5685           19  118.053365   533    0329</pre>

<p>A few points are worth noting:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don&#8217;t see any collisions here for 0 - 19, but there are
  in the rest of the 0 - 99.</li>
<li>No matter what integer we use as the source, the resulting hash will always be a fixed length: 4 digits.  In other words, the hash will always be less than or equal to 9999.  (Actually, it will be less than 6180).</li>
<li>Because the hash is always an integer between 0 and 6180, we know that if we have a set of over 6180 numbers, we are guaranteed to have collisions.</li>
<li>Zero does not hash particularly well with this algorithm.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a great hash for creating a simple rainbow table to learn
  how they work.  Before we do so, however, let&#8217;s look at the
  notion of reduction functions.


<h2>Reduction&nbsp;Functions</h2>


<p><em>Reduction functions</em> are at the heart of how rainbow tables
work.</p>

<p>To understand reduction functions, lets look at a set of two-digit
  plain text that are &#8220;encrypted&#8221; into four-digit hashes.
  For example, the hashing algorithm above hashed 10 into 0823.

<p>Now, imagine if we had a special function r that could somehow map
a 4 digit hash to a 2 digit plain text.  For example, a really simple
reduction function could take the last two digits of a four digit
number, so that r(0823) is 23.  But, in general, it will not be so.
But, the range of r <em>is </em> a two digit number, which means it is from
the domain of valid passwords.

<p>The domain of a reduction function is hash values.  Its range is
  plaintext passwords.  It is worth repeating that the reduction
  funtion is NOT the inverse of the hash.  In the example above, 0823
  &#8220;reduces&#8221; to 23, but 23 does not hash into 0823 (23
  hashes into 5603 using hash function#2 above).</p>

<h2>Chains and Rainbow&nbsp;Tables</h2>


<p>Recall that all hash functions can have collisions.  This is also
true for reduction functions.  In fact, the situation tends to be
worse for reduction functions.  In our simple example, we&#8217;re
mapping four digit numbers into two digit numbers.  Clearly,
we&#8217;ll frequently collide!</p>

<p>The collisions are a real problem for rainbow tables.  One strategy
to reduce (but not eliminate) their impact is to use multiple
reduction functions.

<p>
Consider the table below, where h1=H(p1), p2=R1(h1), h2=H(p2),
p3=R2(h2), h3=H(p3).  Note the use of a single hash fucntion H and
two reductions R1 and R2.

<pre>
p1        h1    p2        h2    p3        h3
 3	3955	55	4532	45	3708
10	0823	23	5603	56	5850
25	2059	59	3626	36	4202
68	3131	31	3790	37	5520
91	2554	54	3213	32	5109</pre>

<p>The Rainbow Table (RT) of the above does not store the whole table.
Instead, it stores the left-most column and the right-most column, and
we calculate the values in between as needed.  That is, we use 10
entries to represent the 30 entries in table above.  Of course, there
is a cost -- we have more calculations to do. It is a tradeoff between
size and speed.

  <p>
Each row of the RT is a <em>chain</em>.

  <h3>Example #1: Given hash = 5520</h3>
  
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a hash value of 5520 that you want to
reverse.  Let&#8217;s look it up in our RT.

<pre>
p1	  h3
 3	3708
10	5850
25	4202
68	5520
89	5109</pre>


<p>So, we take 68 and hash it to get H(68) = 3131.  We apply our
reduction function: R1(3131) = 31.  Next, we hash 31: H(31)=3790.  We
check if that is the value we started with (namely, 5520); if it is
not, and repeat the steps.  That is, we apply our second reduction
function, R2(3790) = 37.  We hash 37, H(37)=5520.  We check if this is
the value we started with (namely 5520), and it is!  So we stop,
  knowing that 37 hashes into 5520.  So our plaintext is 37.</p>


<h3>Algortithm Recap</h3>

<p>So let&#8217;s recap the algorithm we have seen so far:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find the hashed value in the lookup table.
  <li>Take the plaintext value and hash it.
  <li>Does that hash match the hash we have?
   If so, stop. The value you just hashed is the value you're looking for.
  <li>If not, apply the reduction function to get a new plaintext value,
   and go back to step 2.
</ol>

  <h3>Example #2: Given hash = 3626</h3>

<p>So what happens if the hashed value we have is not in the lookup
table?  For example, what should we do if we started with the hash
3626?  Step 1 in our algorithm obviously isn&#8217;t sufficient!</p>

<p>The solution is to apply the reduction function.  Since this is
essentially walking backwards through the chains, we apply the last
reduction function: suppose R2(3626) gives 36.  Hash that number,
H(36)=4202, and try the algorithm again.  We see that its
corresponding value for p1 is 25.  Now we can go on to step 2: H(25) =
2059.  Step 3: Is 2059 the hash number we&#8217;re looking for?  No,
we looking for 3626, so on to step 4: R1(2059) = 59.  Back to step 2:
H(59) = 3626.  Step 3: Is 3626 the number we&#8217;re looking for?
Yes!  Therefore, 59 is its plaintext.</p>

<p>So, let&#8217;s rewrite the algorithm a little bit:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Find the hashed value in the lookup table.  If you find it, go to step 2.
    If not:<ol type=i>
      <li> Starting with the <em>last</em> reduction function (e.g.,
      R2), "reduce" the hashed value to get a new plaintext.  Every
      time you repeat step 1, you go to the next lowest reduction
      function (e.g., R2, then R1).
      <li> Hash the new plaintext  and repeat step 1 from he beginning
      with this new hash value.</ol>
 <li> Take the plaintext and hash it.
 <li> Does that hash match the hash we have?
   If so, stop. The value you just hashed is the value you're looking for.
      <li>If not, apply the reduction function to get a new plaintext value, and
   go back to step 2.
</ol>
<p>Essentially, step 1 backs you up column-by-column in the rainbow table until you find a hash and can match a row.  Then, steps 2-4 move you forward through a specific row to obtain the value you need.  (And if you don&#8217;t find a value in these steps, then your rainbow table doesn&#8217;t have the information you&#8217;re looking for.)</p>

<p><b>Exercise</b>: Reverse the hash 2554.</p>

<p>So, there you go &#8211; a gentle introduction to Rainbow Tables.
Hopefully this will help make other descriptions (such as those
at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_tables"
target="_blank">wikipedia</a>
and <a href="http://kestas.kuliukas.com/RainbowTables/"
target="_blank">kuliukas</a>) a bit easier.  I encourage playing
around with
the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pI5DPYdPDmWT6ZCA5RD4oRg"
target="_blank">spreadsheet</a><em> </em>and walking through the
process with other sample values.</p>

<h2>Addendum</h2>


<p>
Paul: I’ll update this more later (or just replace it), but wanted to
comment on the fact that there is an important difference between my
sample rainbow tables and those in the Wikipedia article.  In my
rainbow tables, the leftmost column is plaintext, and the rightmost is
a hash.  In the wikipedia article, the rightmost column is also
plaintext.  It is the same table, but they do one extra reduction
(R3).  This means that you can’t look up your hashed value in the
table -- the first thing you MUST do is run your last reduction, and
then look up the resultant plaintext.  Why would you do this?


<p>
Space.


<p>
In my example (and the wikipedia example), the plaintext and hashes
are similar sizes (and small).  In reality, if you’re dealing with MD5
or SHA-1 hashes, your plaintext values are going to be MUCH shorter!
So, you can save a lot of space by doing one more reduction, and using
the reduced values instead.  Of course, you increase the risk of
collisions (and run extra calculations), but that is the price of
admission.
