Abstract: This chapter is about how computer systems authenticate
users.  We focus on the password system of Linux in detail and that of
Windows briefly.  Cryptography forms the backbone of any password
system.  We sketch the password cracking procedures and describe a lab
experiment that uses well-known carcking tools.

<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> User Authentication  Approaches</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Authentication of Users, Services, Servers, Documents, &#x2026;  is a
corner stone of computer security.
</p>

<p>
Is there a computer system that has no user authentication at all?
This is not an intrinsic property of old PCs running older OS, but the
result of decisions made regarding the control of access.  (i) Systems
that contain "valuable" resources wish to grant different degrees of
access to different users.  (ii) Systems that can become pawns
("pwned") in a larger scheme of malicious activities.  This makes it
necessary that a user authenticate himself.
</p>

<p>
User authentication, on ordinary computer systems, is almost always by
a password.  As long as the user has given the right password for Joe
User, most systems accept the user as Joe.  This widespread use of
passwords is mostly because the technology for using other methods,
such as biometrics, is far too expensive.  The password method fails
mostly because people do not carefully chose passwords, and also
because there are ingenious and computationally extensive techniques
that can guess a password.
</p>

<p>
"Over the Internet, no one knows you're a dog."  &#x2013; Anonymous.  This
joke illustrates a problem that the same password is used whether you
are logging on the console or remotely logging in from a thousand
miles.
</p>

<p>
All approaches for human authentication rely on one or more of the
following:
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> What You Know</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Something you know (e.g., a password).  Unfortunately, "Axiom: It is
beyond the capabilities of the human brain to remember enough strong
passwords" &#x2013; source unknown.  And if you write it down, then other
people might find it.
</p>

<p>
The term "CAPTCHA" is an acronym for "Completely Automated Public
Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart".  It is a
challenge-response system.  Its purpose is to determine if the
response it receives is produced by a human or a robot script.  The
challenge is usually to present a highly distorted/ segmented/ crowded
image of two words (typically accompanied by a voice recording) and
the user is expected to type it out.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> What You Have</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Something you have (e.g., <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=security+token&tbm=isch">Security Tokens</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=security+smart+card&tbm=isch">Security Smart Cards</a>) with
you can be used to authenticate.  Of course, it might get stolen.  The
transmission from the "reading" device to the authenticator is assumed
to be "unbreakable".

<p>
Several laptops, and iPhone (2013) have incorporated finger print
scanners.  Unfortunately, biometric sensors are expensive and the
accuracy is yet to be widely tested.  There are proposals on face
recognition (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a> wiki/ VeriFace), voice
recognition, etc.  DARPA wishes "to turn humans into passwords" by
capturing what they have "done" on the computer system; read

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Password verification is now increasingly out-sourced.  Facebook,
Google, et al. provide <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> service.  OpenID is an open API standard

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Choosing Good Passwords</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The goal is to make password cracking difficult.
</p>

<p>
1997.01.02, PA News: "A recent survey by Compaq in the financial
district of London showed that poor choices are the norm for computer
passwords there. A staggering 82% of the respondents said they used,
in order of preference, "a sexual position or abusive name for the
boss" (30%), their partner's name or nickname (16%), the name of their
favorite holiday destination (15%), sports team or player (13%), and
whatever they saw first on their desk (8%)."
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> DOs and DONTs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
<b>Don't</b> use the following for passwords: Your first name.  Your last
name. Your login name. Your pet's name.  Names and birth dates of
spouses, friends, relatives and friends.  Any name at all. SS
number. House number. Telephone number. Your bank PIN.  Any password
shorter than six characters.
</p>

<p>
<b>Don't</b> use the same password for all your accounts.  An attacker who
broke into one account usually discovers these other accounts by going
through the memoranda that the user keeps in his files as well as by
running keystroke loggers or simple sniffers.
</p>


<p>
<b>Do</b> use passwords of six characters or more.  Use a combination of
letters, numbers, and special characters. E.g., the following advice
is found on the web.
</p>


<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Think of a memorable phrase, such as "over the hills and far away,
to grand mothers house we go."
</li>

<li>Next, turn it into an acronym (including the punctuation): <code>othafa,tgmhwg.</code>
</li>

<li>Add complexity by substituting numbers and symbols for letters in
the acronym. For example, substitute 0 for o, 3 for e, 7 for t and
the at symbol (@) for a: <code>07h@f@,7gmhwg.</code>
</li>

<li>Add more complexity by capitalizing at least one letter,
such as H. <code>07H@f@,7gmHwg</code>.
</li>

<li>Finally, do not use the example password above.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Of course, we must be aware of password cracking/stealing procedures
in choosing passwords.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Bad Common Practices</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
Most passwords are typed by real humans in real time.  It is
unreasonable to expect that people will choose either long passwords
("pass phrases") or difficult passwords.  Any requirement that
ultimately causes people to write passwords down on paper or in a file
defeats it.
</p>

<p>
This obvious point is lost on most system administrators and auditors.
E.g., consider the following guidelines:
</p>

<p>
"In addition to the password requirements below, please also remember
that your password is case sensitive and you should always change your
stored password on any mobile devices you use.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The password length must be 8 to 14 
</li>
<li>The password must contain a letter.
</li>
<li>The password must contain at least one of these special characters:0123456789<sup>()</sup>&#x2013;!$
</li>
<li>Do NOT use names or common words in the dictionary.
</li>
<li>Do NOT use the following symbols %#.@
</li>
<li>Do NOT use the last four digits of your SSN.
</li>
<li>Do NOT use your CAMPUS Account username, your first name, or your last name.
</li>
<li>Do NOT use 3 or more repeated (i.e., aaa or 111) or consecutive (i.e., abc or 123) characters.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Frequently, the recycling of previously used passwords is forbidden.
This implies that the old passwords are stored somewhere.  If and when
that system is intruded, not only the current passwords but all the
old passwords are revealed.  We must realize that many users use the
same passwords on multiple systems.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> One Time Password (OTP) Authentication</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Because of the "human issues" (referred to above as wetware)
  involved, a password that can be used only once is better. This
  OTP is generated from a secret phrase that the user remembers or
  holds in a tiny device, and a next-use one time password is
  randomly generated. OTP provides protection from eavesdropping,
  and dictionary attacks.  No secret algorithms are used and no
  secrets are stored on host.  See RFC 2289 for further
  details of OTP.
</p>

<p>
There are many implementations of OTP.  E.g., <code>apt-get install
    donkey otp otpw yubiserver</code> on Ubuntu. 
  <a href="http://linotp.org/">http://linotp.org/</a> " <a href="http://linotp.org/">http://linotp.org/</a>  Smartphone
  apps for OTP.  Android OATH tokens.
</p>

<p>
To make the experience of using OTP concrete, we describe briefly
  the procedure to login to a machine S that supports S/Key OTP.
  (That is, the <code>ssh, login, su</code> and other
  password-requiring programs on S are OTP-based programs.)
</p>



<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Initialize S/Key.  (The <code>donkey</code> is an
alternative for S/KEY's commands.)  E.g., calculate ten OTPs at
once:
</li>
</ol>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-text">% donkey -n 10 -f md5 80 is12345
Enter passphrase : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
71: RAG GLOB REAL BRAD RUNS QUAD 
72: GAY GUN DRAB FOR NECK MILL   
73: CLAY YARD DUSK LOY DUNE CAL  
74: DING SLOT SOAR WILD LOST DOE 
75: SAT WEST WEAN MAD NAVE SLIM  
76: MAST KNOT JAIL FIGS EDEN HE  
77: KILL COOT SNOB SAND TESS HAY 
78: CORE VASE SHAM AFAR LASS LACK
79: MID EAT DUST OFF DOCK ARAB   
80: JOEL RAVE SWAY APS COL KUDO
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The secret pass phrase (shown as xxx&#x2026;) is typed on the
  local machine.  The <code>is12345</code> is the seed (which is
  sometimes, confusingly, called a "key") consisting of two
  letters and five digits.  The iteration count, in the example
  80, is a number between 1 and 100.  The passphrase can be
  anything, but ought to be 5 words.  Lower/Upper case
  matters.
</p>

<p>
The seed and pass phrase strings are passed through one of
  MD4, MD5 or SHA1, chosen by the user.  It is repeatedly
  "folded" 80 times (in this example).  The server stores the
  final hash (a 64-bit number), the seed, the iteration count,
  and the sequence number (80 now), in the server's S/Key
  database.  The pass phrase is not stored.  Even if someone
  gains access to the S/Key database, they will need to reverse
  the hash to find the next OTP.  A simple algorithm
  "translates" the 64-bit hash into six words, as shown
  above.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>      Run the above command on S after logging into S using your
  existing login procedure.  You have just set up OTP good for
  80 uses.1. 
When you wish to login to the server, the server provides a
  challenge, which consists of the  chosen hash, the seed and
  a next-lower sequence number, 79.  The user goes through the
  same procedure used to produce the initial step and hashes it
  79 times. The resulting 64-bit hash is the OTP to be supplied
  in this login.  Note that this will not be the same as the
  hash stored in the S/Key database, which has been hashed 80
  times.  The server hashes the supplied password one more time.
  If it matches the stored hash, the user is authenticated. The
  server updates the databse with the supplied password and the
  next-lower sequence number (79) for use in the next login. 

<p>
After 80 uses, the user must re-initialise with a new seed,
  and optionally a new pass phrase.
</p>
</li>
</ol>


<p>
To login via s/key in the future, paste "80 is12345" into the
  s/key calculator (donkey) running on local machine. Type in
  your passphrase.  This generates the response on the local
  screen.  Paste the response into the ssh, telnet-ssl or
  ftp-ssl window to login to S.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Multi-factor authentication provides additional layers of security on
top of password protection.  Suppose your username/password became
known.  To access the system you would need to submit other
"tokens/keys".  Multi-factor authentication requires two or more of
the three factors that you know/have/are.  The password has been the
classical "you know" part.  What "you are" are the biometric factors.
The what "you have" category includes various hardware (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.yubico.com/yubikey">http://www.yubico.com/yubikey</a>" yubi key ) or software tokens.  There
are also several smart phone two-factor apps.
