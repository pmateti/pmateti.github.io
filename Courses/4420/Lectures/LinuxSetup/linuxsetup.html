<p>
<b>Abstract</b>: This is an overview of Linux tailored to the needs of
CEG 4420/6420 students who are expected to have had fair exposure to
Linux already.  It provides background material on Linux and our
choices in the course.  It tries to instill a sense of responsibility
a student is expected to have as the super user.  It gives pointers to
reliable information on Linux system administration.

<h3><a name="Educational_Objectives">Educational Objectives</a></h3>

<ol>
  <li>To provide background on Linux and our choices in the course.</li>
  <li>To instill a sense of responsibility as the super user.</li>
  <li>To give pointers to reliable and compact information on Linux
  system administration.</li>
</ol>

<p>The prerequisite of CEG 4420/6420 Computer Security is a course on
OS internals.  Our course depends on Linux for all its lab
experiments.  Most of the details of a lab depend only on
&quot;the&quot; general Linux environment, not on specifics of a
distribution of Linux.  Even though you have taken a prerequisite
OS course, it is likely that the issues covered/mentioned in this
article are unfamiliar to you.</p>

<h2><a name="Linux_in_the_WSU_Labs">Linux in the WSU Labs</a></h2>

<p>
All work of CEG 4420/6420 should be carried out in such a way that no
sysadmin of any lab has any issues with your work.  Depending on the
lab experiment, you may disconnect the machines and re-connect as
needed.

<h2>Multiboot Grub Menu</h2>

<p>Ideally your laptop/ desktop should have hard disk installed
Debian/Ubuntu, and Windows for all classes to use.  We suggest the following
Linux variants for use by CEG 4420/6420.

<ol>
  <li><tt>For ALL classes: Default Linux OS</tt>
    (Linux-Debian-Ubuntu-HDD-install-NFS-home-dirs).  This is the
    default OS.  This is a full scale installation of Ubuntu on the
    hard disk.  Network is set up with essentially "static" addresses,
    etc. Your home directories are mounted from the NFS server
    192.168.17.111.</li>
  <li><tt>Only-for-CEG4420: Linux-Debian-Knoppix</tt>.  This is meant
    for CEG 4420/6420 students.  No DHCP.  No network setup.  Students
    of this course (should) know how to do these.  </li>

  <li><tt>Only-for-CEG4420: Linux-Debian-Kali</tt>.  This is also
    meant for CEG 4420/6420 students.  All the above
    applies. Kali/BackTrack is a large and excellent collection of
    security tools. </li>

  <li><tt>Windows-10 for all classes.</tt>  Login as "student".
</ol>

<h3>Debian</h3>

<p>The Debian ( <a href="http://www.debian.org">www.debian.org</a> )
development group has so extremely conservative goals that their
so-called stable distribution uses several years old Linux kernel, is
so unaware of the effect of their naming conventions that their
so-called &quot;unstable&quot; distribution is more stable than most
releases from RedHat, Mandrake and Suse. </p>

<h3>Knoppix</h3>

<p>Knoppix (<a href="http://www.knoppix.org/">
http://www.knoppix.org/</a>) is based on the Debian distribution.
Knoppix chooses a careful mix of packages from the stable, unstable,
testing and experimental versions of Debian.  Knoppix pioneered pretty
accurate hardware detection.  Knoppix also pushed the development of
compressed file systems that uncompress on-the-fly the needed
portions.  This make it possible for Knoppix to include in the space
of some 650 MB the equivalent of 2 GB uncompressed files.  Knoppix
selects the &quot;most useful&quot; of the software packages to
install in that 650 MB compressed file system.  It includes everything
needed in a typical CS class: C/C++ compilers, Gnu Emacs, gdb, Open
Office, etc.</p>

<p>When you boot from this live DVD, you are automatically logged
in, without a password, as a user named <tt>knoppix</tt>.  Through the
KDE-K/KNOPPIX/RootShell, you can get a root shell without
password.</p>


<h3>Kali/BackTrack</h3>

<p>
Kali Linux (<a href="http://www.kali.org/"> http://www.kali.org/</a>)
is a re-designed version of BackTrack
(<a href="http://www.backtrack-linux.org/"> www. backtrack-
linux. org/</a>).  These are Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions with a
collection of security and forensics tools.  When you boot from these
distributions, you are automatically logged in, without a password, as
root.  The actual root password is <tt>toor</tt>.</p>

<h2><a name="Linux_on_Your_Own_Machine">Linux on Your Own Machine</a></h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual
    property sense to everything it touches.&quot; -- Steve Ballmer,
    Microsoft CEO, June 1, 2001. Quotable quote?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>We encourage you to set up Linux on your own
  machines.    New to GNU/Linux?  There are several guides for newbies; e.g.,
  <a href="http://linuxnewbieguide.org/">
    http:// linux newbie guide. org/</a> Scan the various forums of Linux
  sites to get a feel for what is involved in setting up Linux on a
  machine that you will be in charge.</p>

<p>Linux is open source.  It is cost-free only if you download ISO
images available from certain sites.  If you were to buy Linux
distributions, you will also get a printed copy or two.</p>

<h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>

<p>Linux's hardware requirements are quite low.  It is available on
 non-PC platforms, with non-x86 CPUs, such as Apple old Macs, Sun, and
 SGI, but it is easiest and cheapest to do it on a PC clone.</p>

<p>Linux driver releases for various hardware items are often several
months behind the corresponding Windows drivers.  Typical hardware
items that have this problem are video cards and wireless devices
(mice, keyboards, and 802.11).  I suggest you chose hardware that is
about six-months old.  Linux does work on 386, 486, ..., but it is
going to be difficult to install a modern Linux distribution on such
old systems.  </p>

<p>As long as the CPU is a Pentium III (equivalent) or above, the MHz
GHz speed is unimportant.  Hard disk size depends on how carefully you
will prune the Linux installation.  WSU electronic surplus often sells
machines for under $50 that would be suitable for your Linux
setup.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Linux Distribution</h3>

<p>There is not much point, in this document, to go into the polemics
of why I chose Debian Ubuntu for this course.  So, for your Linux system
on your own computer, you may wish to chose other distributions.  Here
are some suggestions.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">www.distrowatch.com</a>
for pointers to distributions.  Consider either the &quot;major&quot;,
&quot;live CD&quot; distributions (visit
<a href="http://www.frozentech.com/content/livecd.php">
www.frozentech.com/</a> for a list) or the
 ones mentioned below.</p>

<p>The typical distribution will require you to devote one or two
partitions exclusively for Linux use.  Currently (2013), Debian/
Ubuntu, Red Hat/ Fedora, Suse/Novell are the leading commercial
choices.  Debian is often called a meta distribution because many
other distributions, both commercial and free, are derived from it.
Debian used to be hard to to install, but not any more (> 2005).  The
number of pre-compiled ready to install packages that Debian has is
unmatched.</p>

<p>If you are not comfortable partitioning a HDD, consider a live
CD/DVD Linux.  These do not alter the contents of your HDD in any way.
There are excellent &quot;live CD&quot; distributions that run
entirely off the DVD/ CD.  Obviously, your own work must be saved
somewhere else -- a persistent volume, a removable media or on a
remote file server.  Currently (2013), Knoppix, and Kali BackTrack are
excellent choices.</p>

<p>The Linux distribution  
<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/"> http://www.gentoo.org/</a> expects
you to compile every thing from source code bundles, after configuring
everything to suit you.  On a typical PC, this can take tens of hours.
"Extreme performance, configurability and a top-notch user and
developer community are all hallmarks of the Gentoo experience."

<h3>Linux Installation</h3>

<p>Linux installation is now quite easy.  Power on the PC, insert the
USBD/ DVD/ CD before BIOS POST finishes, and answer questions.  However, there
are two places where you must be careful.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mistakes made in partitioning the hard disk drive (HDD) can wipe
  out everything you have on the HDD.  Some mistakes cannot be undone
  even by the best of experts.  Safest is to use a separate and entire
  HDD for Linux only.  Next safest is to create new Linux partitions
  in the free (unallocated) space on the HDD.</li>

  <li>Mistakes made in the boot-setup may make other OS that you may
  have on the HDD unbootable.  An expert should be able to fix this
  problem.  My advice is that until you are comfortable with
  boot-setup, boot from a USB disk (USBD).  And, when you are
  comfortable, boot setup using GRUB2.</li>
</ol>


<a name="LinuxonaUSBDrive"></a>
<h3>USBD (USB Thumb Drives)</h3>

<p>A full scale Linux can be installed on an 8 GB USB drive; see the
<a href="#Lab Experiment">
lab experiment</a> on this below.</p>

<p>
<a name=grub.cfg></a>
There is a so-called "frugal installation" of a DVD-unpacked files on
to a USBD/ HDD.  The following provides a few grub2 stanzas taken from
my USBD.  Replace the backslash + newline with just a blank.</p>

<pre>
menuentry "Booting via USBD /boot/grub/grub.cfg" {
 linux16 /boot/memtest86+.bin
}

set timeout=-1  # booting from USBD, no timeout
set default=1   # stanza number
set menu_color_normal=red/yellow
set menu_color_highlight=black/light-gray
set root=(hd0,1)  # USBD == hd0, first partition

menuentry "Linux Knoppix 7.2.x 64-bit frugal-install" {

<h2><a name="Linux_File_System">Linux File System</a></h2>

<p>We will be dealing primarily with ext2/ext3/ext4 file system. 
Become familiar with the following.</p>

<h3>The Pseudo File System /proc</h3>

<p>The /proc directory presents many of the OS internal data
structures as if they were files.  These data structures, and
hence these files, do not exist when the OS is not running.  Look
at the output of <tt>tree /proc</tt>.  This listing, on my home
PC, is 70605 lines long.  A few selected entries from /proc, that you
should know about, are shown below in the ls -l format.  Be aware that
the size fields shown as 0 are inaccurate.  So, e.g., <tt>cat
/proc/cmdline </tt> shows the arguments supplied to the Linux kernel
by the OS boot loader.</p>

</pre>

[Depending on the distribution, some of these "files" may not exist.]
Physical memory is mapped to /dev/mem, kernel's virtual memory space
is mapped to /dev/kmem.  The /proc/kcore is also the kernel's virtual
memory space in the in ELF format of: <tt> # file /proc/kcore</tt>
produces <tt>/proc/kcore: ELF 64-bit LSB core file x86-64, version 1
(SYSV), SVR4-style, from 'BOOT_IMAGE=(hd0,5)/vmlinuz ro
root=LABEL=KubuntuPrecise ro' </tt> on my home PC.  Standard ELF
utilities, such as objdump, can be used.

<h2><a name="Linux_for_the_Programmer">Linux for the Programmer</a></h2>

<p>A program is a binary file produced by a linker that links several
object code files produced by a compiler.  Every OS has a small
number of formats for for programs.  On Linux, this standard is
known as ELF.  A program is a passive entity.  In
particular, it does not &quot;run&quot; -- a process does.</p>
<p>A process is created by the OS as a result of &quot;invoking&quot;
a program.  A process is an active entity: it is born, it has a
life and it is expected to die.</p>

<p>Scripts are files of text written for a specific interpreter. 
Linux expects the first line to name the interpreter in a so-called
&quot;shebang&quot; (#!)  line.  Script files often have
executable permissions, which means that the shebang-named program
should be invoked and then given the script file to interpret.</p>

<p>Become familiar with at least the following commands.</p>

<p>In the context of a course like our Computer Security, you will be
  downloading and building programs written by others.  Often enough,
  we will be dealing code written a few years ago and then
  unmaintained.  You should learn to cope with such tar balls.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of changes you are expected to be able to
do without any sweat.  In the lab on Sniffers, we will be working with
Sniffit.  The <tt>configure</tt> script as bundled will prematurely
exit on a modern Linux setup.  Do the following and it will build.

1.  Comment-out the "exit" on line 1001 of ./configure
2.  Insert  "target_os=linux-gnu		# pmateti" just above
the line "case "$target_os" " (line 1095 or 1096) of ./configure
3.  Re-run ./configure.
4.  make

<h2><a name="Linux_System_Administration">Linux System Administration</a></h2>

<p>A certain amount Linux sys admin learning is necessary in this
course.  </p>


<a name="BeingRootUser"></a>
<h3>Being Root User</h3>

<p>As you will see in the next section, it is easy to become root
(superuser).  When you become root, be careful.  Very careful.</p>

  <p>Even though this course is a playground for security, we
    take ethics and personal responsibility seriously. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not deliberately damage any files or equipment.</li>
    <li>If you found a clever trick to break into systems, consult with Dr 
      Mateti before conducting any such &quot;experiment&quot;.</li>
    <li>That some users may not have protected their files does not make it 
    ethical to go read their files.</li>
    <li>Plagiarism goes at least one step further, unethically: Passes off 
    someone else's work as your own.</li>
    <li>We respect your privacy.  Your activity on our systems is not, in 
    general, monitored. But, be aware that we may do so intermittently or 
    continuously, even without informing you.</li>
  </ul>


<p>Along with being root comes a great deal of responsibility way
beyond what was described above.  Double, triple- check a command
before you hit return.  Be very sure of the arguments you supply to
the commands.</p>

<h3>Network Setup</h3>

<p>Network set up is covered in the <a href="../NetUtils">NetUtils</a>
Lab.  Note that even though we have a dhcp server running in the lab
that doles out static IP addresses based on Ethernet addresses, most
of the lab experiments require that the PCs you are using are isolated
from the LAN that the server is on.</p>

<p>Make sure Network Manager (also named network-manager) or wicd
processes are not running.  These make network set up simpler for
non-technical users, but we need to become familiar with the step they
hide.</p>


<p>Become familiar with the following commands/files.</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>
  Exact names and their contents of the dir <code>/var/log</code> are
  distribution specific, but can generally be described by the table
  below.  The log files are typically ordinary text files, but not
  always.  We have listed only the log files that are of interest in
  the security context; on your system, do a <code>ls -lR
    /var/log</code> to see the complete list.

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td>/var/log/auth.log</td>
    <td>authentication events (logins and logouts)       </td></tr>
  <tr><td>/var/log/btmp</td>
    <td>Log of all attempted bad logins to the system; <code>man
    lastb</code>.  See also wtmp, utmp.  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>/var/log/dmesg</td>
    <td>
      Collection of kernel messages; <code>man dmesg</code>; dmesg
      stdouts this file and the current contents of the
      kernel-internal "ring buffer". </td></tr>
  <tr><td>/var/log/*dm.log</td>
    <td>
      Desk top managers (kdm, gdm, lxdm, ...) log files.  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>/var/log/messages</td>
    <td> Misc system logs; see also syslog </td></tr>
  <tr><td>/var/log/utmp</td>
    <td>
      Logged data of current user sessions; <code>man
      utmp</code> </td></tr>
  <tr><td>/var/log/wtmp</td>
    <td>
      Data on completed sessions; <code>man wtmp</code> and
      <code>man last</code> </td></tr>
  <tr><td>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</td>
    <td>
      X11 server log.  Individual user errors are logged in
      ~/.xsession-errors  </td></tr>
  <tr><td>/var/log/syslog</td>
    <td>
      The system log file.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The log files are rotated.  The last rotated log file is given the
  extension of .1 and the earlier ones are compressed and given the
  extenstions .2.gz, .3.gz, and so on.  This rotation is controlled by
  /etc/logroate.* file(s).
</p>

<p>The directory <code>/var</code> is expected to be a separate file
  volume so that a DoS does not happen when a process deliberately
  misbehaves causing a lot of logging.  Often the <code>/var/log</code>
  is hosted on a separate server.
</p>

<p>Even without a DoS happening, log files can grow to be large and
  contain important logs buried like a needle in the hay.  There are
  special log examining tools.

<h3>Start ssh Service (in BackTrack)</h3>

<ol>
<li> Generate the host id keys: <tt>sshd-generate</tt>
<li>Start ssh service: <tt>start ssh</tt>
<li>Assign a password to the root account: <tt>passwd</tt>
</ol>


<a name="Telnet"</a>
<h3> Enable Telnet Service</h3>

<p>Recent distributions of Linux are not installing the telnet service by
default.  Rather than trying to install the binary packages that will
have specific library dependencies, it is better to to compile and
install telnetd, et al.  The following is a link to a local copy of the source
that Debian (and its derivatives Ubuntu, Knoppix and BackTrack) uses:
<a href="http:./inetutils_1.8.orig.tar.gz">
inetutils_1.8.orig.tar.gz</a>.  Build it as usual; that is: untar,
configure, and make.  This tar ball provides
<tt>telnet ifconfig ping telnetd ftp libinetutils/ talk whois ftpd
talkd</tt>.</p>

<p>Append to <tt>/etc/inetd.conf</tt> the following one-liner:<br>
<tt>telnet stream tcp nowait root /root/inetutils-1.8/telnetd/telnetd
telnetd</tt> assuming that the path
/root/inetutils-1.8/telnetd/telnetd is correct.  Restart inetd.
Create a new non-root user using the <tt>adduser newme</tt> whose
password is chosen by you.  Verify that telnet works by
trying <tt>telnet localhost</tt> on P3 and logging in as newme.</p>

<a name="smb"></a>
<h3>Configuring SMB File Sharing</h3>

<p>In Windows, choose a directory to share (say, C:\). Right click on
C:\ and select Properties > Sharing.  Select advanced sharing and fill
in details.  Create a "dummy" user named <tt>root</tt> via MyComputer
-&gt; Manage -> Users.

<p>In Linux, mount
the Windows folder with
<tt> mount //192.168.17.25/C /tmp/WinDirC</tt>. It should prompt for
the password you created.

e.g., mount //192.168.17.5/C /tmp/shared
