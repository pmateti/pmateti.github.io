** Booting Up Timeline, a total of about 15 secs?

1. Yes! [Excluding graphical login.] [On machines from 2010+]
1. SSDs? Even less.

* System Startup

** BIOS

1. [[./bootup.org]]  Study it!

** UEFI

** GRUB

1. All modern (2015+) Linux distros use Grub2.
1. Are there security issues in GRUB?
1. http://hmarco.org/bugs/CVE-2015-8370-Grub2-authentication-bypass.html
   Back to 28: Grub2 Authentication 0-Day, Dec 2015.

1. Does it still work?  Does the attacker have to be present physically?

1. Should we place a password on Grub?

1. [[./bootup.org]]

** Before Kernel Begins

1. OS-Boot-Loaders (OSBL) do not check (deeply) hardware or the kernel.
1. They do check for "magic numbers".
1. Open the kernel as a file at the path name given, using borrowed
   portions of OS code built into OSBL.
1. Load the program into real (non-virtual) memory.
1. Pass control to the kernel.

** After Kernel Begins

1. Device discovery and initialization
1. Virtual memory initialization

* Files and Mounts

1. [[./filesMounts.org]]   Study it!

* After Kernel Begins

1. Perform a variety of checks ...
1. Its main goal is to invoke the program named "init".  Locations
   searched for: =/sbin= and =/etc=.
1. Extremely poor practice: Path name of init given to the
   OS-boot-loader; ex: =init=/bin/bash=

* After Init Begins

1. Save the kernel logs, spewed during boot but before init.
1. Where? On a separate system.
1. When do we mount the rest of volumes?
1. Every action of init must be logged.

* Security Implications of a "Bad" Boot

1. *Everything* is compromised.
1. And, you may not even recognize it!
1. Unauthorized access -- yes.
1. Trojans invoked as trusted programs -- yes.
1. Check the trustworthiness of a file/ program -- answers yes,
   because of rootkits and Trojaned libraries.  [Such forward
   references will be resolved.]

* Hibernation

1. https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate
   Recommended Reading.

* What is Kernel Doing after init has Begun?

1. Discussion Topic!  Start from how we should interpret "doing"?
   =init= has begun -- does it end?
1. See syllabus.  Discussion 5% Bonus.  Active participation in the
   group discussions is expected.
