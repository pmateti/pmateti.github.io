* Abstract

Abstract: We discuss how a computer system boots from powering up to
user login prompt.  Our focus is on what + how things can "go wrong"
from a security point of view.  This discussion is specific to Linux
and Intel x86.  But similar steps are valid for other computer
systems.  So that a technique is understood, we often gloss over the
details, even if it is at the risk of precision, but not at the level
of "whole truth".


* Educational Objectives

Student should be able to

  1. Describe how a computer system boots from power-on.
  1. Recognize the possibilities for Trojans.
  1. Recognize unneeded daemons.
  1. Develop a proper secure boot configuration

* Events

  This discussion is specific to an architecture (such as x86 PC) and
  OS (such as Linux).  But similar steps are valid for other computer
  systems. So that a technique is understood, we often gloss over the
  details, even if it is at the risk of precision, but not at the
  level of "whole truth".  On the other hand, we often give specifics
  such as the exact name of a file even including the version number
  etc so that thngs are really clear. Obviously such details were
  valid at the time of writing, and may have to be adjusted at the time
  of reading.

Event scale: Mega events, major events, minor events, micro events.
The following are mega events.

1. Power On to OS Loader Selection.
1. OS Loader to OS Kernel Selection.
1. OS Kernel Initialization to the First Process init.
1. From Init to User Login.
1. Powering/Shutting down.

* Power On to OS Loader Selection

[UEFI/BIOS and TPM are discussed later.]

** Powering Up

  System Startup: Two states a) Power Off b) Power On

  State: Power off.   Is CPU Working? No.

  State: Power On; Hard Disk motor speeds up.  What should CPU do
  when power is first applied?

  The moment it is on, CPU Fetches, Decodes and Executes
  instructions.  So who points to this instruction? Program counter
  is an internal register of CPU.  Program counter gives this
  instruction address and its value increases. And this increment of
  pc value is done in decoding phase so that next instruction can be
  properly located.

   What is the first value that the pc has? Value is typically
  zero but need not be; can also be some other number.

   Now how do we make sure that the PC value is zero initially?
  When powered on the RESET SIGNAL will cause the CPU to make the
  pc Value to Zero. So CPU should do the Zero instruction first and
  now the fetch decode, execute is started.  Reset Signal is not only
  wired to CPU but also to Sub Systems E.g., Monitor. All Sub Systems
  have to be powered on.

   What should be there in Memory location Zero? A valid
  instruction.

   What type of memory is it? Not a volatile RAM, but a memory
  that can retain its contents even while powered off.  For reasons of
  upgradeability, it is often based on a technology that permits
  read-many-times, but write-only-a-few-times, often mislabeled ROM.



   From the moment the machine is powered on to the moment when you
  can see the first character on the screen what happened?

   BIOS, what does it do? BIOS contains many routines. When
  instructions are executed from address zero on wards, BIOS routines
  are called. E.g., Display a character onto the screen. All the
  routines that accomplish this task of printing a character on to the
  screen can be considered together as a device driver.  An the BIOS
  contains such drivers for many devices: keyboard, HDD, floppy,
  video, etc. BIOS device drivers are limited.  BIOS has minimally
  functional drivers.  Some OS (e.g., Linux) avoid non re-entrant code
  and avoid BIOS routines. 

  The Power On self Test (POST) is a test that BIOS performs from the
  power-on moment till we begin to see the characters on the
  screen. Even if a video monitor is not there to show these messages,
  it communicate via other means such as it beeps. 

   OS is not in ROM.  It is on the hard disk.  How do we choose the
  starting point to load the OS code? The program counter should be
  set to that. After the instruction at zero has loaded the OS code on
  the starting position then you can jump to the OS code. So somewhere
  the BIOS routines will read from the hard disk and put the OS code
  below the BIOS space. And then the routine jumps to this code.

  Note: New OSs do not use BIOS routines. Its not necessary that all
  BIOS routines be executed.

  What is the size of OS boot loader code that is loaded by the BIOS routine
  discussed above? 446 Bytes.  This code is part of MBR (master
  boot record) as it is known in the PC world.  Its main job is to
  bring more data from the hard disk.  Now in this 512 Bytes, there
  should be another program. And this program can bring more data from
  the hard disk and will be loaded further below in the mem.  The
  program that is brought in is usually the OS Loader.  Further details:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record

* OS Loader to OS Kernel Selection

  How do you identify starting position of MBR?  "First"
  track, first sector.  First track is usually numbered zero. 

   It is the job of OS loader to bring Kernel.  Why cant MBR itself
  bring the Kernel?  It is not capable of bringing the Kernel
  because of MBR's small size. So MBR gets the OS loader and that in
  turn loads the Kernel.  In our OSIS (Operating Systems and Internet
  Security) Lab machines, the OS Loader is NT Loader.  OS Loader can
  bring-in and pass control over to yet another porgram.  Lets say OS
  loader gets the OS. So now OS is loaded. Now CPU invokes
  instructions from the OS. 

  OS will bring its own device drivers and may or may not use BIOS
  routines.  All devices are initilized.

  Privileged instruction only when CPU is in the supervised
  mode. During the process of getting data from initial to OS loader
  the CPU is in privileged mode. This is a good place to do bad
  things. OS now loaded can change MBR so that next time when system
  boots up another program runs. And this is called boot sector
  infection.

  A good OS will switch to the user mode as soon as possible. OS
  Designers try to get privileged mode off , Memory management on as
  soon as possible.

  Contents of OS (not OS Loader): 1) Device Drivers 2) File system. (
  it includes algorithms, while file volume is passive stuff on the
  hdd without algorithms) 3) Memory management. 4) Process management
  (creation, destruction and control of processes)

  The above four together can be called a Kernel.

  OS is now able to create the very first process. In Unix, it is
  called Init. As yet we have not seen the login prompt. Only choice
  user had so far was OS loader asked the user which OS the user
  wished to boot into, and we choose Linux.

* OS Kernel Initialization to the First Process init


  Officially, a kerenel is not a program.  What is the size of Kernel?
  Varies widely.  Depends on what is included (drivers, file systems,
  ...) and also on whether there is a separate initrd.img.

** Init Process

  INIT: Init is the first process created by the kernel. Its process
  (PID) is a 1.  It is by far the most important process.  Init
  process is running while the operating system is alive. This process
  has to be alive in order to keep the OS completely
  functional.

  There are many "init" programs that can become init processes.
  Ubuntu used "upstart" in 2009 and now (2017) uses "systemd", whereas
  many other Unix distributions used the so-called Sys V init.  The
  rest of this subsection is about a middle-of-the road "generic"
  init.

=% file /sbin/init=
/sbin/init: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64,
version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux
2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=0x4efe732752ed9f8cc491de1c8a271eb7f4144a5c,
stripped

  Init lives while the OS is alive. Its watches the many processes
  that also must be alive. Just in case, e.g., a getty dies, init will
  start another Getty.

  The init process is table driven. It looks into a file re what it
  has to do.  It is usually located
  at [[./inittab.html][/etc/inittab]].  It's like a bunch of
  rules. Init process reads this file and acts accordingly.  The
  details of the =inittab= file depend on the Linux
  distribution.  The file names mentioned below therefore may be
  different in the version of Linux we currently have.

  =Rc.boot= is a shell script.  Init invokes rc.boot via
  the shell. A shell is invoked as an interpreter for statements in
  rc.boot.  Bash is an example shell.  It is a compiled program and
  init invokes bash shell and executes line by line statements of
  rc.boot.

  =Rc.multiuser=: There is yet another condition in
  the =/etc/inittab= which invokes
  =rc.multiuser=. OS says: Now that I am in full control, I
  allow multiple users.  Before this the OS was in single user mode,
  i.e., the root . 

** Run Levels

   A run level is a number, usually 0 to 6.  Each level abstracts the
   expected activity of the system.  Traditionally the levels are used
   as follows:
0	Halt the system.
1	Single-user mode (for special administration).
2	Local Multiuser with Networking but without network service (like NFS)
3	Full Multiuser with Networking
4	Not Used
5	Full Multiuser with Networking and X Windows (GUI), KDE/Gnome
6	Reboot.

Services that get started at run level N are determined by the
/etc/rcN.d/ directories which contain symlinks to the /etc/init.d
files.  The first letters of these processes is either a K or an S.
The next two characters are digits chosen so that an ls listing is
ordered as needed by the run level.  The Kxy* processes are run when
init is leaving the run level N.  The Sxy* processes are run when init
is entering the run levl N from some other run level.

  The
  following are some of the important processes that are created
  during the startup of a typical Unix (including Linux) system.

  
 The first letter of some processes is k.  The letter k indicates
  processes that are kernel processes.  Similarly the tail letter 'd'
  indicates processes that are commonly called Daemons. The daemons
  are alive while the OS is alive and fully functional.  A death of a
  daemon is a sign of something gone wrong with the system.


  'SYSLOGD': The syslogd process is a daemon that logs all system
  events into a text file, typically /var/log/messages. The system
  administrator determines which events are worth keeping track of.
  This is a very important process in terms of security since the
  attacker takes care to see that he eludes this process from
  monitoring his events. Only an incompetent attacker tries to kill
  this process, which makes it too obvious to the system administrator
  that something is wrong with the system. Killing of this process
  does not damage the system's functionality, but a further log of
  events stops.

  'KLOGD': The 'klogd' process is very similar to the syslogd process
  but it monitors the events of the kernel. This process records the
  return values of the functions that are run, and creates a log file
  so that it is available for fault detection at a later time.

** Network Setup

   Network set up would typically happen in run level 2.  That is,
   ifconfig, and route command would have been run, and the contents
   of /etc/resolv.conf would have been setup.

  INETD: This is the "server of servers" through which all
  network serving connections are established. For example, if some
  other machine requests a telnet connection the, inetd process grants
  the connection.  In this action, two configuration files
  /etc/inetd.conf and /etc/services are consulted.  A more secure
  variant, called = xinetd=, of the functionality is now
  more commonly used.

  RPC.PORTMAP: As the name suggests, this process contains the map of
  all the active ports of the system. The abbreviation rpc stands for
  Remote Procedure Calls. This process allocates the port for a
  request by a local server, and can answer a remote clients regarding
  where a certain service is listening..

  LPD: This is the printing services daemon. This process controls all
  the printing activities on the system.  =cupsd = also has
  the same functionality.

  HTTPD: The collection of the httpd processes is is the web server
  running on the system.  This web server takes the request from the
  user's browser and gives back the required HTML file. The program
  called Apache, is our httpd on Linux.  



* From Init to User Login

GETTY: The getty processes run on different virtual terminals on the
  Linux system.  The getty process is in charge of a user's attempt to
  login.  =Getty= Other processes discussed above do their jobs and die but
  getty should not die.  For every (virtual) terminal we run one
  =getty= program.  What does getty do?  

1. Getty prompts with "login:".  When it receives input, it runs the
   program called =/bin/login=.  This is a compiled binary program.
   When you have typed your user-id, /bin/login starts running. It
   takes the login-ID.  Passwords are stored in an encrypted from in
   the file =/etc/shadow=.  The login name entry causes the getty +
   login program to get the actual password from the shadow file of
   the system.

2. User enters the password.  This password is then encrypted using
   the same encryption algorithm.  The result is compared with the
   password obtained from the data base. 

3. If the two match, the user is allowed to log into the system and a
   shell is started at this point.  The path name of the shell is
   given in /etc/passwd file.

The 'getty' process runs till the user is logged in. That is at the
'login' prompt the process that is in control is 'getty'.  Once the
user is logged in, the shell is started.  The shell takes over the
console from 'getty'.  Eventually the user logs out.  After the user
logs out, the login prompt reappears and the console is back in the
control of 'getty'.

The moment of looking up the password (in an encrypted form) and
  matching it with the password entered is a vulnerable point.  There
  are programs which can 'sniff' the password entered.  There are
  programs that can systematically 'guess' a password.  They may
  succeed after a zillion attempts, but at the rate of, say, 1000
  password-guesses/second, it will not take very long.



* UEFI BIOS Boot Sequence

BIOS (Basic Input Output System) is being replaced by UEFI (Unified
Extensible Firmware Interface) in current (2011+) PC motherboards.
UEFI gets control soon after the PC is powered on, just as BIOS did.
It controls all the hardware -- in particular, boot devices.  Its
software is partly embedded in ROM chips and the rest is on a
persistent storage device (typically a hard disk) in /efi/ directory.

The UEFI can be genuinely considered an operating system.  A typical
UEFI implementation includes a mouse driven GUI.  Some UEFI
implementations contain MP3 players, web broswers, hdd backup tools,
malware scanners, etc.  Every UEFI implementation must comply with the
UEFI standard.

Every UEFI firmware chip is pre-loaded with a secure key.  The OS
(Linux, Windows, ...) can use this key to verify which drivers and
executables can be trusted.  The figure included here
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[./platform-integrity-win8.png]]
(from blogs.msdn.com 2011) describes
Windows 8 boot sequence; similar sequences are expected to happen on
all PC based OS.

In the OSIS Lab, we are using rEFInd, a UEFI boot manager. See
references.

* Trusted Platform Module

Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a secure cryptoprocessor hardware,
often called the TPM chip or TPM Security Device.  Together with the
BIOS/UEFI, the TPM forms a root of trust.

It can generate cryptographic keys, and random numbers.  It can
generate a (nearly) unforgeable hash-key summary of the hardware and
software configuration.  A third party can /remotely attest/ that the
software has not been changed.  /Binding/ encrypts data using the TPM
endorsement key, a unique key burned into the chip during its
production.  This enables hardware device authentication.  /Sealing/
encrypts data, similarly to binding, but also specifies a state that
the TPM must be in before order the data is decrypted (unsealed).

There is a research project, TrustedGRUB, that extends GRUB with a
connection to the TPM to /measure/ the binary configuration of modules
to be loaded using SHA-1.  The resulting measurements are securely
stored within the /Platform Configuration Registers (PCR)/
of the TPM.  These values can then be used in attestation.


* Shutting/Powering Down

A full scale OS must be shut down gracefully before a machine is
powered off.  Why? Because there is considerable amount of "state"
information that is stored only in volatile RAM, e.g., buffers that
need to be written to HDDs.

Most Linux systems enter the single user state, from the
typical multi user run level, prevent any user from logging in.  This
includes requesting all processes to terminate.  All file volumes are
unmounted.  Networking is shutdown. Finally, power is shut down.

=lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     6 Oct  9 11:45 /sbin/halt -> reboot=\\
=lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     6 Oct  9 11:45 /sbin/poweroff -> reboot=\\
=-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 14784 Oct  9 11:45 /sbin/reboot=\\
=-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 84904 Oct  9 11:45 /sbin/shutdown=\\

The above commands as well as pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del generates an event
that the init process intercepts initiating the shut down sequence.
These commands check that the user invoking them is effectively the
root user.  Read the man pages for the differences in the above.  Note
that symlinks use the fact that =argv[0]= points to the name of the
program invoked and based on this string value behave diffrently.

Good power supplies are capable of detecting an impending power outage
and raise an even that =init= notices.
