<h1>The Process of Booting</h1>
<p>
 This discussion is specific to an OS (such as Unix) and an
 architecture (such as ix86 PC).&nbsp;&nbsp; But similar steps are
 valid for other computer systems. So that a technique is understood,
 we often gloss over the details, even if it is at the risk of
 precision, but not at the level of &quot;whole truth.&quot;</p>
<p>
 System Startup: Two states a) Power Off b) Power On</p>
<p>
 State: Power off.&nbsp; Q: Is CPU Working? A: No.</p>
<p>
 State: Power On; Hard Disk motor speeds up. Q: What should CPU do when power is first 
 applied?</p>
<p>
 A: The moment it is on, CPU Fetches, Decodes and Executes instructions. Q: So who points 
 to this instruction? Program counter is an internal register of CPU.&nbsp; Program 
 counter gives this instruction address and its value increases. And this increment of pc 
 value is done in decoding phase so that next instruction can be properly located.</p>
<p>
 Q: What is the first value that the pc has? A: Value is typically zero but need not be; 
 can also be some other number.</p>
<p>
 Q: Now how do we make sure that the PC value is zero initially?<br>
 A: When powered on the RESET SIGNAL will cause the CPU to make the pc Value to Zero. So 
 CPU should do the Zero instruction first and now the fetch decode, execute is started.&nbsp; 
 Reset Signal is not only wired to CPU but also to Sub Systems&nbsp; E.g., Monitor. All 
 Sub Systems have to be powered on.</p>
<p>
 Q: What should be there in Memory location Zero? A: A valid instruction.</p>
<p>
 Q: What type o f memory is it? A: Not a RAM.</p>
<p>
 Q: From the moment the machine is powered on to the moment when you can see the first 
 Character on the screen what happened?</p>
<p>
 Q: BIOS, what does it do? BIOS contains many routines. When instructions are executed 
 from address zero on wards, BIOS routines are called. E.g., Display a character onto the 
 screen. All the routines that accomplish this task of printing a character on to the 
 screen can be considered together as a device driver.&nbsp; An the BIOS contains such 
 drivers for many devices: keyboard, HDD, floppy, video, etc. BIOS device drivers are limited. 
 BIOS has minimally functional drivers.&nbsp; Some OS (e.g., Linux) avoid non re-entrant 
 code and avoid BIOS routines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 The Power On self Test (POST) is a test that BIOS performs from the power-on moment till 
 we begin to see the characters on the screen. Even if a video monitor is not there to 
 show these messages, it communicate via other means such as it beeps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Q: OS is not in ROM.&nbsp; It is on the hard disk.&nbsp; How do we choose the starting 
 point to load the OS code? A: The program counter should be set to that. After the instruction at zero has 
 loaded the OS code on the starting position then you can jump to the OS code. So 
 somewhere the BIOS routines will read from the hard disk and put the OS code below the 
 BIOS space. And then the routine jumps to this code.</p>
<p>
 Note: New OSs do not use BIOS routines. Its not necessary that all BIOS routines be 
 executed.</p>
<p>
 Q: What is the size of OS code that is loaded by the BIOS routine discussed above? A: 512 
 Bytes.&nbsp; This code is part of MBR (master boot record) as it is known in the PC 
 world.&nbsp; Its main job is to bring more data from the hard disk.&nbsp; Now in this 512 
 Bytes, there should be another program. And this program can bring more data from the 
 hard disk and will be loaded further below in the mem.&nbsp; The program that is brought 
 in is usually the OS Loader.</p>
<p>
 Q: What is the size of Kernel? A: widely ranges. Let us say ½ to 2 meg and this has to be 
 brought in and placed below the above mentioned 512 bytes.</p>
<p>
 Q: How do you identify starting position of MBR?&nbsp; &quot;First&quot; track, first sector.&nbsp; 
 First track is usually numbered zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Q: It’s the job of OS loader to bring Kernel.&nbsp; Why cant MBR itself bring the Kernel. 
 A: its not capable of bringing the Kernel because of MBR's small size. So MBR gets the OS 
 loader&nbsp; and that in turn loads the Kernel.&nbsp; In our OSIS (Operating Systems and 
 Internet Security) Lab machines, the OS Loader is NT Loader.&nbsp; OS Loader can bring-in 
 and pass control over to yet another porgram.&nbsp; Lets say OS loader gets the OS. So 
 now OS is loaded. Now CPU invokes instructions from the OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 Os will bring its own device drivers and may or may not use BIOS routines.&nbsp; All 
 devices are initilized.</p>
<p>
 Privileged instruction only when CPU is in the supervised mode. During the process of 
 getting data from initial to OS loader the CPU is in privileged mode. This is a good 
 place to do bad things. OS now loaded can change MBR so that next time when system boots 
 up another program runs. And this is called boot sector infection.</p>
<p>
 A good OS will switch to the user mode as soon as possible. OS Designers try to get 
 privileged mode off , Memory management on as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
 Contents of OS (not OS Loader): 1) Device Drivers 2) File system. ( it includes 
 algorithms, while file volume is passive stuff on the hdd without algorithms) 3) Memory 
 management. 4) Process management (creation, destruction and control of processes)</p>
<p>
 The above four together can be called a Kernel.</p>
<p>
 OS is now able to create the very first process. In Unix, it is called Init. As yet we 
 have not seen the login prompt. Only choice user had so far was OS loader asked the user 
 which OS the user wished to boot into, and we choose Linux.</p>
<h3>Init Process</h3>
<p>
 For our purposes here, there are many &quot;init&quot; programs that become init 
	processes.&nbsp; Ubuntu (2009) uses &quot;upstart&quot; whereas many other Linux 
	distributions still use the so-called Sys V init.&nbsp; The rest of this 
	subsection is about this init.</p>
<p>
 The init process is  table driven. It looks into a file re what it has to do.&nbsp; 
 It is usually located at <a href="inittab.html">/etc/inittab</a>.&nbsp; It's like a bunch 
 of rules. Init process reads this file and acts accordingly.&nbsp; The details 
 of the <code>inittab</code> file depend on the Linux distribution.&nbsp; The file names 
 mentioned below therefore may be different in the version of Linux we currently 
 have.</p>
<p>
 <code>Rc.boot</code> is a shell script.&nbsp; Init&nbsp; invokes rc.boot via the shell. A shell is 
 invoked as an interpreter for statements in rc.boot.&nbsp; Bash is an example shell.&nbsp; 
 It is a compiled program and init invokes bash shell and executes line by line statements 
 of rc.boot.</p>
<p>
 <code>Rc.multiuser</code>:&nbsp; There is yet another condition in the <code>/etc/inittab</code> which invokes 
 <code>rc.multiuser</code>. OS says: Now that I am in full control,&nbsp; I allow multiple users. 
 Before this the OS was in single user mode, i.e., the root .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 <code>Getty</code></p>
<p>
 This is another program.&nbsp; Other programs discussed above do their jobs and die but 
 getty should not die. For every (virtual) terminal&nbsp; we run one <code>getty</code> program.&nbsp; What does getty do? 
 Getty prompts with &quot;login:&quot;.&nbsp; When it receives input, it runs the program called 
 <code>/bin/login</code>. This is a compiled binary program.&nbsp; When you have typed your user-id,&nbsp; 
 /bin/login starts running. It takes the login-ID and password. Passwords are stored in an 
 encrypted from in a file <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p>
<p>
 Init lives while the OS is alive. Its&nbsp; watches the getty&nbsp; processes. Just in case a getty dies, 
 init will 
 start another Getty.</p>
<h2>On To the Login Prompt</h2>
<p>
 The following are some of the important processes that are created during the startup of 
 a typical Unix (including Linux) system.</p>
<p>
 The first letter of some processes is k.&nbsp; The letter k indicates processes that are 
 kernel processes.&nbsp; Similarly the tail letter 'd' indicates&nbsp; processes that are 
 commonly called Daemons. The daemons are alive while the OS is alive and fully 
 functional.&nbsp; A death of a daemon is a sign of something gone wrong with the system.</p>
<p>
 INIT: Init is the first process created by the kernel. Its process (PID) is a 1.&nbsp; It 
 is by far the most important process.&nbsp; Init process is running while the operating 
 system is alive. This process has to continuously run in order to keep the OS completely 
 functional and if we happen to kill this process due to some reason the system is surely 
 going to crash.</p>
<p>
 'SYSLOGD': The syslogd process is a daemon that logs all system events into a text file, 
 typically /var/log/messages. The system administrator determines which events are worth 
 keeping track of.&nbsp; This is a very important process in terms of security since the 
 attacker takes care to see that he eludes this process from monitoring his events. Only 
 an incompetent attacker tries to kill this process, which makes it too obvious to the 
 system administrator that something is wrong with the system. Killing of this process 
 does not damage the system's functionality, but a further log of events stops.</p>
<p>
 'KLOGD': The 'klogd' process is very similar to the syslogd process but it monitors the 
 events of the kernel. This process records the return values of the functions that are 
 run, and creates a log file so that it is available for fault detection at a later time.</p>
<p>
 INETD: This is the &quot;server of servers&quot; through which all network serving connections are 
 established. For example, if some other machine requests a telnet connection the, inetd 
 process grants the connection.&nbsp; In this action, two configuration files /etc/inetd.conf 
 and /etc/services are consulted.&nbsp; A more secure variant, called <code>
 xinetd</code>, of the functionality is now more commonly used.</p>
<p>
 RPC.PORTMAP: As the name suggests, this process contains the map of all the active ports 
 of the system. The abbreviation rpc stands for Remote Procedure Calls. This process 
 allocates the port for a request by a local server, and can answer a remote clients 
 regarding where a certain service is listening..</p>
<p>
 LPD: This is the printing services daemon. This process controls all the printing 
 activities on the system.&nbsp; <code>cupsd </code>
 also has the same functionality.</p>
<p>
 HTTPD: The collection of the httpd processes is is the web server running on the system. 
 This web server takes the request from the&nbsp; user's browser and gives back the 
 required HTML file. The program called Apache, is our httpd&nbsp; on Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 GETTY: The getty processes run on&nbsp; different virtual terminals on the Linux system. 
 The getty process is in charge of a user's attempt to login.&nbsp; The following events 
 occur.</p>
<p>
 1. The login name entry&nbsp; causes the getty + login program to get the actual password 
 from the database of the system.&nbsp; The password so obtained is in an encrypted form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 2. User enters the password.&nbsp; This&nbsp; password&nbsp; is then encrypted using the 
 same encryption algorithm.&nbsp; The result is compared with the password obtained from 
 the data base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
 3. If the two match, the user is allowed to log into the system and a shell is started at 
 this point.</p>
<p>
 The 'getty' process runs till the user is logged in. That is at the 'login' prompt the 
 process that is in control is 'getty'.&nbsp; Once the user is logged in, the shell is 
 started.&nbsp; The shell takes over the console from 'getty'.&nbsp; Eventually the user 
 logs out.&nbsp; After the user logs out,&nbsp; the login prompt reappears and the console 
 is back in the control of&nbsp; 'getty'.</p>
<p>
 The moment of looking up the password (in an encrypted form) and matching it with the 
 password entered is a&nbsp; vulnerable point.&nbsp; There are programs which can 'sniff' 
 the password entered.&nbsp; There are programs that can systematically 'guess' a 
 password.&nbsp; They may succeed after a zillion attempts, but at the rate of, say, 1000 
 password-guesses/second, it will not take very long.</p>

 <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Describe the Missing Processes</font></b></p>
<p>
 Objective:&nbsp; Make you <i>study</i> the booting sequence ending at login prompt.&nbsp; 
 The specific processes you identify as required are unimportant.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Freshly reboot into your choice of Linux (Knoppix or BT).&nbsp; Wait for 
	the GUI to show.</li>
  <li>Save the output of <code>ps -aux.</code>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You will notice several gaps in the process id numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<ol type="a">
  <li>This step is encouraged but not graded: Consider process ids in the ranges 
	of 1 to 100, and 900 to 1000.&nbsp; Note the missing ids. Among the missing 
	ids, explain the details of <i>at least five</i> processes from the range 1 
	to 100 and 900 to 1000 that must have come to life, performed their duties, 
	and terminated.</li>
	<li>This step is required and graded:&nbsp; Explain the details of <i>at least five</i> 
	processes (from the PID range 1 to the highest PID you see in the above ps 
	aux list)&nbsp; that are no longer alive.</li>
	<li>Be aware that the bash shell has many built in commands such as echo 
	that do not cause process creation.</li>
</ol>
	</li>
  <li>Among the currently running processes, identify <i>all</i> the daemon processes, and 
  how and where from they were invoked.</li>
  <li>The specific names of script files in the current installation of Linux 
  are not necessarily rc.multiuser etc as indicated in the sections above.&nbsp; 
  Find and correct all such names.</li>
</ol>
<p>
 Turn in a Lab Report explaining the above details.</p>
