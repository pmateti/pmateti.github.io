<h1>Secure Shell: ssh</h1>
<h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti">Prabhaker Mateti</a></h2>
<p><b>Abstract</b>
SSH
is the name of a protocol and a collection of associated programs for
secure remote login to execute commands on a remote machine, to
securely move files from one machine to another, and other secure
network services over an insecure network such as the
Internet.&nbsp; This article points out the weaknesses of telnet
and FTP, describes how SSH and SCP overcome these weaknesses, attempts
to persuade the reader to switch over to SSH and SCP, describes the
free versions available and discusses the past exploits of SSH.

<h1><a name="Secure_Shell">Secure Shell</a></h1>



<p>

SSH stands for Secure Shell.&nbsp; Its functionality is similar to

that of telnet and rlogin in that you use ssh to connect to a remote

machine that is running an SSH-server.&nbsp; There are three

primary advantages in using ssh.</p>



<ol>



<li>telnet and rlogin do not

authenticate the remote machine;&nbsp; SSH does.</li>

<li>The password that the user

types as part of the login ritual is sent as clear text by telnet and

rlogin.&nbsp; SSH sends it encrypted.</li>

<li>Telnet and rlogin send and

receive the data as clear text.&nbsp; SSH sends and receives it in

encrypted form.</li>

</ol>



<p>

The main disadvantages are the following.</p>





<ol>





<li>Encryption and decryption

consumes computing and elapsed time.</li>

<li>It can be a

nuisance.&nbsp; E.g., if the remote system has been legitimately

reinstalled, and the installer was not careful to use the same

authentication keys for the host, your ssh will issue a false alarm.<br>

</li>

<li>ssh and sftp are susceptible

to the &quot;<a href="#Past_exploits_of_SSH">man in the middle attack</a>&quot;</li>

</ol>





<p>

Just as <code>telnet, rlogin and

ftp</code> are client programs

talking to their respective server programs using application level

protocols, ssh uses the application protocol defined in RFC TBD.</p>





<h2>

<a name="1._Minimal_Usage">1. Minimal Usage</a></h2><p>

There are a few things that you must understand even if you are interested in &quot;just&quot; using ssh 

in the simplest manner.&nbsp; This being a minimal background section, a few 

things are so simplified that they are &quot;lies.&quot;</p>

<p>

The <a href="#Cryptography">Cryptography</a> article listed below is a prerequisite to this article.&nbsp; 

It explains computational infeasibility, encryption, public and private keys, 

session keys, RSA, DSA, Triple-DES (3DES), &quot;blowfish&quot;, &quot;idea&quot;, etc.</p>

<h3>1.1 SSH suite of programs</h3>





<p>

The SSH suite of programs includes the following.&nbsp; All but

<code>sshd</code> run on the local machine.&nbsp; (Note that the actual programs 

are named using lower case letters.)</p>





<ol>





<li><tt>ssh</tt>:

the &quot;shell&quot; that connects to the remote machine.</li>

<li><tt>scp</tt>:&nbsp;

for batch file transfers. </li>

<li><tt>sftp</tt>:

for interactive file transfers. </li>

<li><tt>ssh-keygen</tt>: generates private-public key&nbsp;

authentication keys</li>

<li><tt>ssh-agent</tt>:

d&aelig;mon used to automate client's authentications </li>

<li><tt>ssh-add</tt>:

loads private keys into ssh-agent process </li>

<li><tt>ssh-askpass</tt>:

X interface for ssh-add </li>

<li><tt>sshd</tt>:

a server program running on the remote machine</li>

</ol>





<p>

In this article, we focus on the <code>ssh</code>

client program.&nbsp; Specific port numbers, etc. that we mention below are the 

defaults.</p>

<p>

The ssh program is invoked by the user.&nbsp; It establishes a TCP connection to port 22 on the server

machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; This program/process is often called the ssh client.</p>

<p>

The service process <code>sshd</code>

on the remote machine will be listening on the port 22.&nbsp; This process is 

often called the ssh server. The user does not explicitly start this process. 

This process is started either when the remote machine booted or on-demand.&nbsp; </p>

<p>

Even though its name includes the word &quot;shell&quot;, the ssh does not include

the functionality of the shells such as bash, csh, or ksh.&nbsp;

Once login is completed, the user is interacting with the usual shell,

but with all his key strokes and output from the shell on the remote

end going through the ssh encryption tunnel.</p>



<h3>

1.2

Public and Private Keys</h3><p>

&nbsp; SSH involves the following.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Public and private keys that identify the user.</li><li>Public and private keys that identify the local machine.</li><li>Public and private keys that identify the remote machine.</li>

</ol>

<p>The public and private keys for the remote machine must have been generated when an OS 

got installed on it as a new machine.&nbsp; (The simplest of the ssh usages does not require items 1 and 2. 

) Upon connection, the <code>sshd</code>

presents the public host key of the server machine. </p>

<p>The client checks

that this key matches the key it has in its own database for that

server machine. If not, it alerts the user and asks if the user wishes

to continue anyway, with or without replacing the conflicting host key

it has. </p>

<p>If this is the first connection being made to the server from this local host, there

are two possibilities: </p>

<ol>

	<li>Consult another machine, called an authentication server, to

verify that the public key presented does indeed belong to the remote host.</li>

	<li>Simply ask the

user if the server host is to be believed. </li>

</ol>

<h3>1.3 Encryption Tunnel</h3>

<p>The two machines (local and remote) now

negotiate a so-called session key (see Cryptography article).&nbsp; All traffic 

between the two from this moment on is encrypted with the session key.&nbsp; 

Note that the session key lasts only for one session.&nbsp; The public/private 

keys are &quot;forever.&quot;</p>

<p>An ssh client can chose the encryption algorithm from among several it has: Triple-DES (3DES), 

&quot;blowfish&quot;, &quot;idea&quot;, etc.</p>

<h3>1.4 User Login</h3>

<p>After establishing the encrypted tunnel, the ssh client asks for user id and 

password.&nbsp; So, even someone eavesdrops on this, the captured user id and 

password will be in a form encrypted&nbsp; by the session key, and considered 

&quot;computationally infeasible&quot; to decipher into clear text.</p>





<p>Here is an example login.&nbsp;

The user pmateti is currently logged in on a machine named <code>milner.osis.cs.wright.edu</code>,

with prompt string PS1 set to <code>'\h:\w%

'. </code>&nbsp; He wishes to

login into the machine named Minsky.</p>





<pre>milner:~ % ssh minsky.osis.cs.wright.edu -l pmateti<br>login as: pmateti<br>pmateti@minsky's password:<br>minsky:~ %<br></pre>





<p>

If the user's name on Milner is also <code>pmateti</code>,

there is no need to specify the <code>&nbsp;-l

pmateti </code>in the invocation of

ssh.&nbsp; It so happens that the prompt string on Minsky is also

set to <code>'\h:\w% '.&nbsp;

</code>

</p>



<p>Currently there are two

versions, SSH1 (old) and SSH2 (current), of the SSH protocol in use.&nbsp;

Depending on this and a few other issues, the above may look slightly

different.&nbsp; Instead of the -l option, it is also possible to

use the command line: milner:~ % ssh pmateti@minsky.osis.cs.wright.edu.</p>


<p>
The program named ssh that you invoked is the ssh-client running on the

local machine.&nbsp; It is the client which collects the user's

password and delivers it securely to the remote machine.&nbsp; But

even before it attempted to collect the password, ssh-client verified

the authenticity of the remote host,

minsky.osis.cs.wright.edu.&nbsp; This is further explained in SSH

internals below.





<pre><br></pre>



<h3>1.6 Files</h3>


<p>
The system wide ssh related files are located in /etc/ssh.&nbsp; User's ssh 

files are in ~/.ssh.&nbsp;



Here is an ls -l listing of my ~/.ssh/.<br>

-----END DSA PRIVATE KEY-----</pre>

<p>My public key (id_dsa.pub) that &quot;matches&quot; the above private key is shown below. 
This should be published in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of the remote machine (in our 
example: Minsky).&nbsp; You should not keep on Minsky the private key that you 
generated on Milner.&nbsp; The ssh client running on Milner presents your 
private key to the sshd on Minsky instead of the usual password.<p>The content 
of id_dsa.pub file is just one long line, but is shown below with inserted line 
breaks.</p>

If your private key is exposed (like I did), you can ssh-keygen again.  Obviously, you need to update all the corresponding public keys.



<h2>2. <a name="Port_forwarding">Port forwarding</a></h2>





<p>Port forwarding is the act of

sending TCP packets addressed to one port on one machine to another machine +

port.&nbsp; Say, you are logged in on Milner via X11, and if you

were to ssh login to gamma (a machine located on a different subnet/floor from OSIS lab), and invoke an X client program, the X11 traffic generated by

that client on gamma will be sent to the X11 server on Milner via the ssh 

tunnel.&nbsp; </p>

<p>More TBD.</p>









<h2>3. <a name="SSH_Best_Practices">SSH Best Practices</a></h2>







(Some of the

consequences of accepting the defaults are discussed .)

<p>TBD</p>

<h2>4. <a name="SSH_Internals">SSH Internals</a></h2>





<p>TBD</p>





<p>SSH protocol uses the public

key system for encryption.&nbsp; The <a href="#SSH_Protocol_Architecture">SSH 

Protocol Architecture</a> article listed below is the official description of 

the protocol.&nbsp; In the next few paragraphs, we summarize these details.&nbsp; 

</p>





<p>

Currently there are two versions, SSH1 and SSH2, of the SSH protocol in

use.</p>

<h2>7. <a name="Password_Conveniences">Password Conveniences</a></h2>



<p>
If you wish to avoid typing your password every time a remote login or file 

transfer is attempted, you must generate a public + private key pair for 

yourself using either DSA or RSA.&nbsp; In this

example,

we use DSA.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<pre>% ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024</pre>










<p>
This generates a public + private DSA key pair. It will ask where to

store the keys. Accept the supplied default

pathnames.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just type Return so that you are not

using a "passphrase". The dialog

with ssh-keygen will look like this:<br>





<pre>Enter file in which to save the key (~/.ssh/id_dsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
ad:a3:7f:39:28:22:f8:42:7f:ac:10:83:c7:61:01:ba pmateti@milner</pre>


<p>
Append the newly generated key to other authorized keys you

may have collected so far.<br>





<br>





<tt>% cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt><br>





<p>Copy this file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the _ is an underscore, not a 

hyphen)) to your home directory on Minsky's (unless Milner and Minsky share the 

home directories, as in our OSIS Lab).&nbsp; All the machines in this lab have a shared /home

directory server from osisServer.osis.cs.wright.edu.</p>

<p>Now you (except root) should be able to log in to Minsky without typing the password.
