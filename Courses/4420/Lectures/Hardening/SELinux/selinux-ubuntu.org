* Overview

1. Prerequisites for this Section: DAC, MAC and SELinux.  Terminology:
   Subjects (active entities, e.g., processes), verbs/ actions (e.g.,
   read), objects (passive entities, e.g., files).  Roles, Labels and
   Types.


1. Caution: Improperly configured, SELinux may not permit the
   completion of a boot.  A Drastic Measure that can Fix This:
   Interact with Grub, and in the =linux ...= line, delete
   =security=selinux= and delete =selinux=1=, insert =selinux=0= and
   press F10.  Or boot from a multi boot USBD (of Lab L1), and edit
   files in =hddroot/etc/selinux/=.


* Install SELinux on Ubuntu

1. SELinux is default on RedHat.  Ubuntu distribution uses AppArmor
   instead; =apt purge apparmor=.  Then, =reboot=

1. =apt install selinux-*= [hyphen-asterisk].  [We are
   over-doing!] May take a minute or two. 

1. =apt install selinux setools-gui auditd= [no-hyphens-no-asterisks].
   Check what your prof installed on his machine: [[./sel-dpkg-list.txt]]

** Config SELinux

1. Configure selinux.  In the file =/etc/selinux/config=, set
   =SELINUX= to =permissive=.

1. Verify the Grub menu entry installed by =apt install selinux=
   #+begin_src bash
menuentry "Linux Kubuntu 18.10 security=selinux selinux=1" {
 linux /vmlinuz ro security=selinux selinux=1 root=LABEL=Kubuntu1810WD37 
 initrd /initrd.img
}
#+end_src

1. =reboot= again.  During the next boot, SELinux builds and saves
   contexts.  Will take longer than usual boot. 

* After the Reboot Explore

   #+begin_src bash
root@Milner:~# sestatus
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             default
Current mode:                   permissive
Mode from config file:          permissive
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Memory protection checking:     requested (insecure)
Max kernel policy version:      31

root@Milner:~# getenforce
Permissive
#+end_src

1. The Grub menu that booted this session will have =security=selinux
   selinux=1= in it.
   : root@Sutherland:~# cat /proc/cmdline 
   : BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-11-generic ro security=selinux selinux=1 root=LABEL=Kubuntu1810WD37 vt.handoff=1

1. In text file =/etc/selinux/config=, change =SELINUX=permissive= to
   =SELINUX=enforcing=

1. The command =setenforce Enforcing= enforces selinux. The command
   =setenforce Permissive= flips selinux to being permissive.

1. Available commands: =man -k selinux=  100+  For our labs, we need
   just a few.

2. After selinux install, config files on Ubuntu:
   1. =/etc/selinux/*=, 60+ files ??
   2. =/etc/selinux.d/ubuntu/*= 50+ files ??

1. =dpkg -L selinux= lists where the files from package named selinux
   were installed.

1. See the files in =/etc/selinux/default/contexts/= (These are text
   files.)

1. Policies are compiled into binary files.
   : root@Sutherland:~# file /etc/selinux/default/policy/policy.31 
   : /etc/selinux/default/policy/policy.31: SE Linux policy v31 8 symbols 9 ocons

1. =default= is the name of the policy installed by the package named
   =selinux-policy-default= The full collection of rules is at
   =/usr/share/selinux/default=.  E.g., take a look at =bzcat
   /usr/share/selinux/default/keyboardd.pp.bz2=

1. The .pp file is the result of =/usr/bin/semodule_package= working
   on .mod and .te files.  It is possible to regenerate .mod and .te
   files from .pp but it is way too cumbersome and skipped here.  See
   https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/selinux/+/9ef48ac/policycoreutils/semodule_package/

1. Linux Security Modules (LSM) API: Dozens of access control hooks
   all over the kernel; see =include/linux/security.h= An LSM, such as
   SELinux, is compiled into the kernel.  Se the results of =grep
   selinx /proc/kallsyms=

1. List the policy modules: =semodule -l=

** SELinux Modes

1. In =/etc/selinux/config= file, =SELINUX= can be set to
      =enforcing=, =disabled=, or =permissive=

   2. Enforcing: Policy is loaded.  When SELinux is enforcing,
      everything is denied by default and a policy determines
      requested access.  See Figure 4.

   3. Permissive: Policy is loaded, but SELinux is /not enforcing/
      it.  Accesses will be logged but not
      prevented.  This mode is intended for testing and debugging.
   4. Disabled: SELinux infrastructure is not enabled. No policy
      loaded.  Logs are not generated.

5. See also what the Grub boot entry should be for selinux to be
   enabled (permissive or enforcing).

** SELinux Logs

1. Brute force check:: =grep -E 'avc:.*denied' -Rn /var/log= This will
   grep all the files in /var/log recursively and report occurrences
   with line numbers and file names.
