* DAC

1. Linux has Discretionary Access Control as a default permissions
   model

1. Examples: File permissions (chmod)
1. Examples: Process ownership

1.  The user (subject) has discretion to set or not security policies.

* MAC

1. Mandatory Access Control enforces a central policy on a system
1. MAC enforcement requires all policies to be specified by an
   administrator.  Users cannot change these policies


* Principles

1. privilege of least authority
       1.  The principle of least authority says you should only give
           the minimum privilege needed

1. fine-grained access control permission to kernel objects
   1.  Read/write permissions are coarse

* SELinux

1. Disables root user priviledges
1.  Several administrative roles with limited extra privileges
1.  Example: Changing passwords does not require root access to
    setting up firewalls


1.  Multi-level security: Declassified, Secret, Top-Secret, etc.
   1.  In MLS, only a trusted declassifier can lower the secrecy
       of a file
   1.  Users with appropriate privilege can read classified files,
       but cannot output their contents to lower secrecy levels
** SELinux Example
1.  Suppose I want to read a secret file
1.  In SELinux, I transition to a secret role to do this
   1.  This role is restricted:
       1.  Cannot write to the network
       1.  Cannot write to declassified files
   1.  Secret files cannot be read in a declassified role
1.  Idea: Policies often require applications/users to give up
   some privileges (network) for others (access to secrets)
          General principles
1.  Secrecy (Bell-LaPadula)
   1.  No read up, no write down
   1.  In secret mode, you can’t write a declassified file, or read
       top-secret data
1.  Integrity (Biba)
   1.  No write up, no read down
   1.  A declassified user can’t write garbage into a secret file
   1.  A top-secret application can’t read input/load libraries
       from an untrusted source (reduce risk of compromise)
** SELinux Policies
1.  Written by an administrator in a SELinux-specific
   language
   1.  Often written by an expert at Red Hat and installed
      wholesale
   1.  Difficult to modify or write from scratch
1.  Very expansive---covers all sorts of subjects, objects, and
   verbs
     Key Points of Interest
1.  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
1.  Type Enforcement
1.  Linux Security Modules (LSM)
   1.  Labeling and persistence
         Role-Based Access
**                       Control
1.  Idea: Extend or restrict user rights with a role that
   captures what they are trying to do
1.  Example: I may browse the web, grade labs, and
   administer a web server
   1.  Create a role for each, with different privileges
   1.  My grader role may not have network access, except to
      blackboard
   1.  My web browsing role may not have access to my home
      directory files
   1.  My admin role and web roles can’t access students’ labs
        Roles vs. Restricted
** Context
1.  Win2k ACLs allow a user to create processes with a
   subset of his/her privileges
1.  Roles provide the same functionality
   1.  But also allow a user to add privileges, such as
      administrative rights
1.  Roles may also have policy restrictions on who/when/
   how roles are changed
   1.  Not just anyone (or any program) can get admin privileges
*      The power of RBAC
1.  Conditional access control
1.  Example: Don’t let this file go out on the internet
   1.  Create secret file role
      1.  No network access, can’t write any files except other secret
          files
      1.  Process cannot change roles, only exit
      1.  Process can read secret files
   1.  I challenge you to express this policy in Unix permissions!
   Roles vs. Specific Users
1.  Policies are hard to write
1.  Roles allow policies to be generalized
   1.  Users everywhere want similar restrictions on their
      browser
1.  Roles eliminate the need to re-tailor the policy file for
   every user
   1.  Anyone can transition to the browser role
*        Type Enforcement
1.  Very much like the fine-grained ACLs we saw last time
1.  Rather than everything being a file, objects are given a
   more specific type
   1.  Type includes a set of possible actions on the object
      1.  E.g., Socket: create, listen, send, recv, close
   1.  Type includes ACLs based on roles
*              Type examples
1.  Device types:
   1.  agp_device_t - AGP device (/dev/agpgart)
   1.  console_device_t - Console device (/dev/console)
   1.  mouse_device_t - Mouse (/dev/mouse)
1.  File types:
   1.  fs_t - Defaults file type
   1.  etc_aliases_t - /etc/aliases and related files
   1.  bin_t - Files in /bin
       More type examples
1.  Networking:
   1.  netif_eth0_t – Interface eth0
   1.  port_t – TCP/IP port
   1.  tcp_socket_t – TCP socket
1.  /proc types
   1.  proc_t - /proc and related files
   1.  sysctl_t - /proc/sys and related files
   1.  sysctl_fs_t - /proc/sys/fs and related files
* Detailed example
1.  ping_exec_t type associated with ping binary
1.  Policies for ping_exec_t:
   1.  Restrict who can transition into ping_t domain
      1.  Admins for sure, and init scripts
      1.  Regular users: admin can configure
   1.  ping_t domain (executing process) allowed to:
      1.  Use shared libraries
      1.  Use the network
      1.  Call ypbind (for hostname lookup in YP/NIS)
**                      Ping cont.
1.  ping_t domain process can also:
   1.  Read certain files in /etc
   1.  Create Unix socket streams
   1.  Create raw ICMP sockets + send/recv on them on any interface
   1.  setuid (Why? Don’t know)
   1.  Access the terminal
   1.  Get file system attributes and search /var (mostly harmless
       operations that would pollute the logs if disallowed)
       1.   Violate least privilege to avoid modification!

*   Linux Security Modules
1.  Culturally, top Linux developers care about writing a
   good kernel
   1.  Not as much about security
   1.  Different specializations
1.  Their goal: Modularize security as much as humanly
   possible
   1.  Security folks write modules that you can load if you care
      about security; kernel developers don’t have to worry
      about understanding security
*                    Basic deal
1.  Linux Security Modules API:
   1.  Linux developers put dozens of access control hooks all
      over the kernel
      1.  See include/linux/security.h
   1.  LSM writer can implement access control functions called
      by these hooks that enforce arbitrary policies
   1.  Linux also adds opaque “security” pointer that LSM can
      use to store security info they need in processes, inodes,
      sockets, etc.
*           SELinux example
1.  A task has an associated security pointer
   1.  Stores current role
1.  An inode also has a security pointer
   1.  Stores type and policy rules
1.  Initialization hooks for both called when created
   SELinux example, cont.
1.  A task reads the inode
   1.  VFS function calls LSM hook, with inode and task pointer
   1.  LSM reads policy rules from inode
1.  Suppose the file requires a role transition for read
   1.  LSM hook modifies task’s security data to change its role
   1.  Then read allowed to proceed
        Problem: Persistence
1.  All of these security hooks are great for in memory data
   structures
   1.  E.g., VFS inodes
1.  How do you ensure the policy associated with a given
   file persists across reboots?
        Extended Attributes
1.  In addition to 9+ standard Unix attributes, associate a small
   key/value store with an on-disk inode
   1.  User can tag a file with arbitrary metadata
   1.  Key must be a string, prefixed with a domain
       1.   User, trusted, system, security
   1.  Users must use ‘user’ domain
   1.  LSM uses ‘security’ domain
1.  Only a few file systems support extended attributes
   1.  E.g., ext2/3/4; not NFS, FAT32
*                   Persistence
1.  All ACLs, type information, etc. are stored in extended
   attributes for persistence
1.  Each file must be labeled for MAC enforcement
   1.  Labeling is the generic problem of assigning a type or
       security context to each object/file in the system
   1.  Can be complicated
1.  SELinux provides some tools to help, based on standard
   system file names and educated guesses
*                   Summary
1.  SELinux augments Linux with a much more restrictive
   security model
   1.  MAC vs. DAC
1.  Understand Roles and Types
1.  Basic ideas of LSM
   1.  Labeling and extended attributes
