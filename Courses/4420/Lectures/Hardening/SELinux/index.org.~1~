* Overview

1. Linux includes DAC by default.  We (root + users) can render it
   useless.  But, cannot disable DAC.
1. SELinux is an implementation of MAC as an LSM for Linux.  Installed
   by choice in some Linux distros.  Others are AppArmour, etc.
   SELinux is the default MAC in Android.
1. SELinux divides access issues to a fine granularity.  It can, e.g.,
   limit the power of the superuser/ root.
1. SELinux is considered by many to be too difficult to learn within a
   week.  We are trying! (in this course)

* Where Does SELinux Fit in DAC+MAC?

1. Recall that With a MAC, the permissions are not governed by the owner of the
   resource.
1. Nor can they be worked around by users.
1. Instead, they are set in stone by the security administrator.
1. In SELinux, this is done through the SELinux policy that is loaded
   at the start of the system.
1. The path name of the policy varies by Linux distribution.  Read
   [[../SELinux/selinux-ubuntu.org]]

** SysCalls in the Presence of LSM

#+CAPTION: LSM (e.g., SELinux) steps in User mode to Kernel Mode

[[./Figures/lsm-access.jpg]]

1. Process with a security id SSec is trying to access (1) the file
   with the security id TSec.
1. Makes a syscall (2).
1. The kernel consults LSM module (3).
1. The user specific security is implemented as a function "f".
1. The kernel will then grant/ deny access to the resource (4).
1. Every syscall goes through SELinux.

* SELinux Conceptual Overview

1. SELinux will grant/deny access on fine grain level.
2. Even root (super user) may be denied.
3. It is all controlled by the SELinux LSM based on a policy.
4. The policy is written up using "subjects", "objects", etc. 
5. These are "labeled".  Aka "contexts".
6. All these are generalized and abstracted (and implemented in kernel
   source code) into the following SELinux entities:
   1. /Domain/ - A label for one or more subjects (processes). Also
      called a domain type.
   2. /Type/ - A label for the object or set of objects.  E.g., file, socket.
   3. /Class/ - The kind of object being accessed.
   4. /Permission/ - The operation (about) to be performed. E.g.,
      read, write.

1. An /allow/ policy rule: =allow domains types:classes permissions;=
1. Principle of Default Denial: Anything not explicitly allowed is denied.


** Example: User Wishes to Execute a Script

#+CAPTION: LSM SELinux Work Flow in {User Wishes to Execute Script}
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt LSM SELinux :title LSM :width 100%
[[./Figures/sel-permissions.png]]



** SELinux Contexts (aka Labels)

1. SELinux assigns a context (aka label) to every object and subject:
   files, directories, programs, processes, network ports, ...

3. Labels encapsulate all security attributes of an object. Labels are
   interpreted by the SELinux Security Server (Figure 4) in the kernel
   and by =libselinux= in user space.

5. The rest of the kernel code and user space view labels as opaque data.
6. New security attributes can be added to labels without having to
   recompile applications or redesign core SELinux code.

   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt SELinux Contexts :title LSM :width 100%
#+CAPTION: SELinux Contexts
[[./Figures/sel-users.png]]

2. SELinux introduces: selinux-user-identity, role, type, and
   sensitivity, in order to divides access issues to a fine
   granularity.
1. Linux user names are mapped to SELinux user names, =*_u=.  [The
   underscore syntax is not required.]
1. A SELinux role =*_r=
1. A SELinux type =*_t=. [An attribute of "type enforcement" (TE) that
   defines a domain for processes.]
1. Optionally followed by a sensitivity level, e.g., =s0=

   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt SELinux Context :title LSM :width 100%
#+CAPTION: SELinux Context
[[./Figures/sel-context.png]]


1. Context Examples
   1. Ex: context of /etc/shadow: =system_u:object_r:shadow_t=
   2. Ex: context of a process: =root:staff_r:staff_t=
3. 100+ types, such as device-type, process-type, file-system-type,
      network type, IPC type, ...
1. =/usr/sbin/semanage fcontext -l= to see the current list of all contexts

1. Add the flag =-Z= to the familiar Linux commands to see the
   contexts.  Examples:
   : $ id -Z
   : system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0

   : $ ls -Z pmNotes-SELinux.org
   : system_u:object_r:unlabeled_t:s0 pmNotes-SELinux.org


** Example Contd.

1. In the example {User Wishes to Execute Script Figure 7}, two
   contexts take part in the activity.
   1. the context of the user process (such as a shell), which is =user_u:user_r:user_t=
   1. the context of the target file, which is =system_u:object_r:lib_t=


** SELinux Contexts/ Labels #2


3. When a user or process requests access to a resource (for example,
   when opening a file), SELinux uses three items to determine whether
   to allow access.
   1. the kind of access requested,
   2. the security context of the process, and 
   3. the security context of the requested resource

1. The security context of a process, called a domain, determines what
   the process can do (what it can access, and what actions it can
   take).  Ex: User, trusted, system, security

1. The security context of an object is called a type.  It gathers the
   security attributes of the object.  These are stored in extra
   attributes XATTRs of the file system.  (Not all file systems can
   have XATTRs.  On such FS, SELinux has to make do with other
   techniques.)

1. On Ubuntu, see the files in =/etc/selinux/default/contexts/= (These
   are text files.)

1. Users also have security contexts.  See the =/usr/sbin/semanage=
   tool.


** SELinux Types and Type Enforcement

1. Objects are given a specific SELinux type.  Type includes ACLs based on
   roles.
3. There are 100+ types, such as device-type, process-type, file-system-type,
   network type, IPC type, ...
1. Device types:
   1.  =agp_device_t= - AGP device (/dev/agpgart)
   1.  =mouse_device_t= - Mouse (/dev/mouse)
1. File types:
   1.  =fs_t= - Defaults file type
   1.  =bin_t= - Files in /bin

1. /proc types
   1.  =proc_t= - /proc and related files
   1.  =sysctl_t= - /proc/sys and related files

** SELinux Policies

1. Written in a SELinux-specific language.

1. An SELinux policy is a collection of rules capturing the boolean
   conditions granting access; see Figures 2 and 4.

1. The path name of the policy varies by Linux distribution.  Read
   [[../SELinux/selinux-ubuntu.org]]

1. Policies are compiled into binary files.
   : root@Sutherland:~# file /etc/selinux/default/policy/policy.31 
   : (on stdout) SE Linux policy v31 8 symbols 9 ocons

1. =default= is the name of the policy installed by the package named
   =selinux-policy-default= 
1. The full collection of rules is at =/usr/share/selinux/default=.
   Some 380+ bzip-compressed files.  E.g., take a look at =bzcat
   /usr/share/selinux/default/keyboardd.pp.bz2=

** SELinux Modes

1. In =/etc/selinux/config= file, =SELINUX= can be set to
      =enforcing=, =disabled=, or =permissive=

   1. Enforcing: Policy is loaded.  When SELinux is enforcing,
      everything is denied by default and a policy determines
      requested access.  See Figure 4.

   2. Permissive: Policy is loaded, but SELinux is /not enforcing/
      it.  Accesses will be logged but not
      prevented.  This mode is intended for testing and debugging.
   3. Disabled: SELinux infrastructure is not enabled. No policy
      loaded.  Logs are not generated.
   4. If you just did =# apt install selinux*=, the value will be
      =permissive=

5. See also what the Grub boot entry should be for selinux to be
   enabled (permissive or enforcing).  Read
   [[../SELinux/selinux-ubuntu.org]]

* SELinux Role-Based Access Control (SE-RBAC)

1. https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Role-based_access_control Do a
   quick read.  Must.

2. Roles may also have policy restrictions on who/ when/ how roles
   are changed.  Not just anyone (or any program) can get privileges.

1. SELinux users have authorized roles.  Roles are authorized for
   domains.  Processes run in their domains.

** RBAC-SEL-Example #1

2. Goal: User named =ta= should be permitted to browse the web, grade labs,
   and administer a web server.
1. Create a role for each, with different privileges
2. =grader= role should not have network access, except to blackboard
   etc. sofwtare.
3. =browsing= role should not have access to files within local
      directory
4. =webadmin= role should not access students’ labs, etc.

** RBAC-SEL-Example #2

1. Goal:  =userlevel1= should be permitted to read a secret file.
1. Transition to a secret role to do this.  This role is restricted:
       1.  Cannot write to the network
       1.  Cannot write to declassified files
1.  Secret files cannot be read in a declassified role

** RBAC-SEL-Example #3

1. Goal: Should not let this file =notontheweb.xyz= to go out on the
   internet.
1. Create secret-file role with no network access
1. Process cannot change roles, only exit
1. Process can read secret files
1. Can this this policy be expressed in Linux DAC permissions?
   1. "On a Linux system, one can make most, if not all, of its
      behavior based on role assignment done through group membership
      and group privileges."

* Constructing SELinux Policies

There are many tutorials and even books on SELinux.  [[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/SELinux/Tutorials][Gentoo Wiki on
SELinux Tutorials]] are sufficient for our work in this course.
However, Gentoo specifics need to be adapted, mildly, for our Linux
distribution.  E.g., =/usr/share/selinux/strict/include/Makefile=
becomes =/usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile= on Ubuntu.  Reading other
tutorials, blogs, manuals is not expected for our course.

* Labs on SELinux

1. SELinux: Is it possible to disable it at runtime?  Here is how:
   =setenforce 0=, set =SELINUX=disabled= in /etc/selinux/config,
   reboot, choose a Grub entry that does not have =selinux=.

1. [[./selinux-lab.org]] is a required lab in this course.  Before
   attempting it, skim the sections above.  Do not skip any.  The lab
   expects you to develop new policies.  Re-read the relevant
   sections.

1. Develop a collection of access control policies, such as those in
   the lab above that can improve the security of a Linux installation.

1. Compare SELinux and AppArmor. Optional Lab.  Read the discussion
   https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/9a0khb/selinux_vs_apparmor/

1. Is sudo /now/ unnecessary? (and /etc/sudoers?)

1. SELinux => Loss of Performance?  Develop a lab experiment that can
   confirm/ deny this based on objective measurements.

* SELinux Critiques

1. That writing SELinux config files is "complicated" is widely agreed.

2. Smack LSM was designed in response to the complexity of
   SELinux. Smack is now part of Tizen, a mobile OS
   https://www.tizen.org/.  Not well-respected.  Search in HackerNews.

3. Comments by "Frustated Users"
   1. http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=288584 Is SELinux crap?
   2. http://symcbean.blogspot.com/2016/11/selinux-sucks.html



* SELinux Design Internals

1. Linux adds an opaque "security" pointer that LSM can use to
   store security metadata in processes, inodes, sockets, etc.

1. A process reads the inode
   1.  VFS (virtual file sys layer) function calls LSM hook, with
       inode and process pointer
   1.  LSM reads policy rules from inode

1.  Suppose the file requires a role transition for read
   1.  LSM hook modifies process’s security data to change its role
   1.  Then read allowed to proceed

1. In addition to standard Linux attributes, associate a small
   key+value store with an on-disk inode
   1.  User can tag a file with arbitrary metadata

** Extended Attributes (XATTR)

1. File systems that support extended attributes: ext2/3/4, ...

1. All ACLs, type information, etc. are stored in extended attributes
   for persistence.

1. Each file must be labeled for MAC enforcement.
