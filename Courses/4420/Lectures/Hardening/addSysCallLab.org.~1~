This lab leads up to hardening the Linux
kernel.

* Background

1. Lab Objectives

1. Learn the Linux kernel API usage.  Use a kernel in the 4.x.y series.
1. Given is a Linux kernel image, and its build setup on our Virtual
   Cyber Security Lab at WSU VCSL.
1. Section 2 of Man Pages is about syscalls.  Study one or two man
   pages of, say, open, and close.  You will be asked to develop/
   write man pages for the new syscalls following these.

* Taks

** Task: Add a Few System Calls

1. Add a new system call that takes a white list of path names of
   programs.  Intent: The currently existing syscall =execv= will not
   work unless the program is on this list.  Prior to invoking this
   system call, all path names are considered to be white listed.

1. Design and implement a simple system program that demonstrates the above.

** Task: Delete a Few System Calls 

1. Add a new system call that takes a list of system call numbers, and
   deletes them.  This will stay in effect until next boot.  The list
   format is argc, argv[].

1. Examine 5 system programs that use the syscalls deleted as above,
   and report on their behavior after the freeze.

** Task: Freeze a Few System Calls

1. Add a new system call that takes a list of system call numbers, and
   freezes them between the after-boot time stamp and
   beginning-to-shut-down time stamp.  This will stay in effect until
   next boot, or unfrozen later.

1. Design the ABI of a syscall that unfreezes syscalls.  Do not
   complain if a syscall is already enabled.

1. Examine 5 system programs that use the syscalls frozen as above,
   and report on their behavior after the freeze.

** Task: Create a new /proc Entry for SysCalls

1. List enabled, frozen, and deleted syscalls.
