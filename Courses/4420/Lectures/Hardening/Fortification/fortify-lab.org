* Educational Objectives

This lab deals with a few fortification steps, postponing hardening to
later labs.

1. Recognize that out of the box installations of OS need both pruning
   and grafting.
1. Examine a Linux installation for what needs to be pruned.  Reducing
   the installed footprint is considered a reduction of attack
   surface.
1. We also need to be proactive in observing suspicious events and
   take action.

* Tasks

** Task: Examine suid Programs

1. TBD Configure /etc/sudoers

** Task: Prune Installed Software

1. Take stock of what software is installed.  
1. Starting from TBD LXU of previous lab, uninstall at least two packages,
   without breaking the installation.  Imagine that LXU is intended
   for use only in supposrt of this course.

** Task: File System Audit

Objective: Experience a file system audit tool.

1. "Tripwire is a policy driven file system integrity checking tool."
   That is, it can detect changes in various (config) files and
   report. Alternate tools: AIDE, OSSEC.

1. Install the package tripwire. =apt install tripwire=

1. Build the database following the instructions found in the 
    package.

1. Select and modify a few &quot;system&quot; files from directories such as 
    /bin, /sbin, /usr/sbin and /etc.

1. Observe and explain tripwire's reports.
1. Install and experience a tool that analyzes log reports (usually in
   /var/log/).

** Task: Log  Analyses

1. Linux records various logs in =/var/log/*=.  There is a log
   rotation system.  To be aware of the logs manually is a tedious
   task.  There are several log analyses tools that help.  See e.g.,
   1. https://www.tecmint.com/best-linux-log-monitoring-and-management-tools/
   2. http://www.pinoylinux.org/system-adminstration/open-source-sysadmin-resources/
      Monitoring and Security sections

2. TBD

** Task: Rewriting SUID Scripts as SUID Programs

  1.  Discover all suid scripts (not binaries) on LXU.
  1.  Carefully analyze and report the need for each of these.
  1.  Rewrite the suid scripts into C/C++ programs.
  1.  Does rewriting scripts into programs improve security?  Discuss.

** Task: Forensics

1.  Install a forensic tool and experience it.

1. TBD

** Task: Audit System

1. Install the monitoring tool: =apt install auditd= and then reaad
   =man auditd= For an example ruleset, read
   https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4629/ BTW the auditd
   package ships with some example configuration files based on a few
   standards. They can be found at /usr/share/doc/auditd/examples/. Of
   course you will still want to tailor them for your individual
   needs. – Jon-Erik Aug 14 '14 at 15:51

1. TBD

** Task: OpenSCAP

1. "Security compliance is a state where computer systems are in line
   with a specific security policy."

1. https://www.open-scap.org/getting-started/ "...  new
   vulnerabilities are being discovered and patched every day,
   enforcing security compliance must be a continuous process.  It
   also needs to include a way to make adjustments to policies, as
   well as periodic assessment and risk monitoring.  The OpenSCAP
   ecosystem provides tools and customizable policies for a quick,
   cost-effective and flexible implementation of such a process."

1. Install OpenSCAP Base.

1. TBD

** Task: Lynis

1. https://cisofy.com/documentation/lynis/ Security auditing, system
   hardening, and compliance monitoring.  Use the free community
   version.

1. TBD

** Task: Rootkit Detection

1. Linux systems have not generally experienced virus attacks.  But,
   worm attacks, backdoors and rootkits have happened enough times.

1. Defend your LXU by installing a rootkit detector and schedule its
   runs periodically.

1. Ex: chkrootkit, rkhunter

** Task: [Devious] [Bonus] Rootkit Installation

1. https://packetstormsecurity.com/ is a whitehat site that hosts the
   sources of several exploits and attacks for research.

1. Find a rootkit source package and make it work within LXU.

1. E.g., Vlany is a Linux 2016 rootkit "that provides process hiding,
   user hiding, network hiding, LXC container, anti-debug,
   anti-forensics, persistent reinstalls, dynamic linker
   modifications, backdoors, and more."
