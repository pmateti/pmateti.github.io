Abstract: This lecture is about adding a layer of 
protection beyond proper configuration of the OS and applications. 
This layer of protection consists of tools that help detect changes in 
the system and monitor (suspicious) system activity.

<h1>Security Fortification</h1>

<p>
Fortification is the addition of packages to improve security.&nbsp;
It should be done after a system has been properly configured with the
supplied components.&nbsp; Fortification frequently will discard a
supplied component in preference to a carefully chosen added
component.&nbsp; Some what rarely, fortification involves deletion of 
components.&nbsp; In our discussion, we will postpone certain
&quot;fortification&quot; items as &quot;hardening&quot; items even
though we cannot offer a rigorous definition regarding the use of
these two terms.</p>

<h2>Malware Detection</h2>

<h3>Virus Scanners</h3>
<p>
Of the many fortification suggestions made in this lecture, virus 
scanners are probably the most universally experienced item.&nbsp; Windows-based 
virus scanners do focus on detecting not only viruses but also Trojans and root 
kits and are often also integrity checkers.</p>

<h3>Root Kit Detection</h3>

<p>Loadable kernel modules (LKM) bring run-time modularity to
  Linux. Device drivers and their modules are loaded only when
  necessary keeping the core kernel small. On the negative side, LKM
  rootkits are the easiest and most “elegant” way to modify the
  running kernel. In a modularized kernel the attacker can insert
  rootkits into kernel once he gains root privileges.  Through LKM
  rootkit the attacker can modify any part of the kernel. Typically
  LKM rootkits would redirect the system calls to the attacker’s own
  implementation.</p>

<p> The character device" /dev/kmem is an image of the kernels
  virtual memory. Through this device, an attacker can modify the kernels text or data, and can drastically change the behavior of
  kernel. Other memory devices which can similarly be exploited are
  /dev/mem and /dev/port which give direct access to physical memory
  of the system.
</p>

<p>
Unless a file system auditor is in place, it is not
easy to spot the root kits after their installation.&nbsp; The time to
be alert is when the root kits are being installed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<h3>User Authentication</h3>
<h3>Host Authentication</h3>
<h3>Service Authentication</h3>

Look up

Kerberos.&nbsp; Read
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LDAPClientAuthentication</a>

<h2>Audit</h2>
<p>
Capture the output of <tt>ps aux</tt> and examine all processes
periodically.  The exact list will depend on the (Linux)
distribution. However, from one session to another, the first few are
not expected to have different process ids. The remainder may get
higher or lower pids depending on what is included in the boot up
scripts. However, once the boot scripts have stabilized you must make
a note of all process ids, and expect them to remain unchanged until
the scripts change again. </p>

<p>
You should also check that all processes owned by user &quot;nobody&quot; are 
running programs explicitly identified as legitimate for untrusted, 
unverified, remote users.&nbsp; Each process belonging to a non-root 
system user is explicitly identified as legitimate for that user in 
this environment.
</p>

<h3>File System Audit</h3>
<p>
Intruders often replace binaries with their own Trojan versions.&nbsp; 
Many system administrators relied on time-stamping and check sum the 
files to determine when a binary file has been modified. But it is 
fairly simple to recreate the same time-stamp for the Trojan file as 
the original file. For example, if your standard <tt>touch</tt> 
does not do <tt>touch -r /bin/login</tt> develop a <tt>touch</tt> 
program that does it.&nbsp; Or, by setting the system clock time back 
to the original file's time and then adjusting the Trojan file's time 
to the system clock. Once the binary Trojan file has the exact same 
time as the original, the system clock is reset to the current time. 
Simple check sum programs rely on a CRC checksum and are easily 
spoofed.&nbsp; MD5 check sums are based on an algorithm that no one 
has yet spoofed.&nbsp; This technology is behind the well known 
Tripwire.</p>


<h3>Activity Monitors</h3>
<p>
A few specific activity monitoring programs are described below.</p>
<p>
TCP Wrapper: When a potentially insecure service must be run, 
tcp_wrappers should be utilized to &quot;wrap&quot; it. The wrapper software 
does more detailed logging and better access control checking by 
&quot;wrapping&quot; itself around the normal network daemons configured in <i>
inetd.conf</i>.&nbsp; The <tt>tcpd</tt> used in Linux is a new 
version of the TCP wrapper.</p><p>
ifstatus is a standalone program to check for 
promiscuous interfaces available from
<a href="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/ifstatus">
ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/ifstatus</a> </p><p>
dtk or &quot;Deception Toolkit&quot; is a kit of fake daemons and services 
designed to waste an intruders time. dtk is available from
<a href="http://all.net/dtk/example.html">all.net/dtk/example.html</a></p>
<p>
Bastille Linux is a series of scripts which tighten up security on stock Linux 
systems, by changing permissions and disabling features.</p>
<p>
Network Information Service (NIS) has been source of many weaknesses. 
Using Rsync + SSH as a replacement for NIS is often better.</p>
<p>
Logs produced by the<tt> kerneld, syslogd, tcpd,</tt> and the 
various services can become so large that it is humanly impossible to 
scan them for spotting suspicious activity and take a more serious 
look.&nbsp; A few well known log analyzers are listed below.</p>
<ol>
 <li>wwwstat, HTTPd Log file Analysis Software,
 <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/wwwstat/">

 <li>Analog, Web server log file analyzer,

 <li>freq, A lastlog analyzer,
 <a href="http://www.bangmoney.org/projects/freq/">

 <li>tcpdstats, tcpd log analyzer,
 <a href="http://www.kaostech.com/products/html/tcpdstats.html">

</ol>

<h2>Improved Kernels</h2>

<p>The kernels supplied in various distributions are generic and 
security-wise permissive.&nbsp; It is possible to recompile the kernel using the 
same source code as used by the distributor but with different selection of 
components and including them in the vmlinuz binary instead of as a dynamically 
loadable module.</p>
<h3>POSIX capabilities</h3>

  <p>POSIX capabilities (Pcaps) can turn a setuid-root file into a
    file with minimum privileges, run a daemon with uid=0 but with
    amost no superuser privileges, etc.  Privileges are granted to
    processes instead of users.  Pcaps are implemented in Linux
    kernels since 2.6.x; capsh, getpcaps, getcap, setcap are some of
    the tools.  Pcaps divide privileges that are typically granted to
    root user.  </p>

  <p>The table below presents PCaps for a few typical suid-root
  binaries.  The CAP-names used are defined in
  /usr/include/linux/capability.h.

<table>
<tr><td>ping</td><td>CAP_NET_RAW (13)</td></tr>
<tr><td>traceroute</td><td>CAP_NET_RAW (13)</td></tr>
<tr><td>chsh</td><td>CAP_CHOWN (0), CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH (2), CAP_FSETID (4), CAP_SETUID (7)</td></tr>
<tr><td>chfn</td><td>CAP_CHOWN (0), CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH (2), CAP_FSETID (4), CAP_SETUID (7)</td></tr>
<tr><td>chage</td><td>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH (2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>passwd</td><td>CAP_CHOWN (0), CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (1), CAP_FOWNER (3)</td></tr>
<tr><td>mount</td><td>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (1), CAP_SYS_ADMIN (21)</td></tr>
<tr><td>umount</td><td>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE (1), CAP_SYS_ADMIN (21)</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>To change, run <tt style="border: 1px dotted blue">chmod u-s /usr/bin/chsh; setcap
  0,2,4,7=ep /usr/bin/chsh</tt>
