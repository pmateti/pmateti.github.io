<p>
We distinguish <i>hardening</i> a system from proper <i>configuration</i> and
<i>fortification</i>.  Carefully adjusting various parameters after an
out-of-the-box install is configuration.  Installing or uninstalling
various packages using the OS native tools and mechanisms, such as
apt-get in Debian/ Ubuntu, is fortification.  Hardening refers to
areas of security tightening during the design and construction of
systems rather than after their deployment.  In this lecture, we learn
howto harden an out-of-the-box installation into a more secure Linux
system.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
We distinguish hardening a system from proper configuration and
fortification.  In this lecture, we describe areas of tightening
security during the design and construction of systems rather than
after their deployment.  This distinction is not common yet.  There
exist several "hardening" scripts, e.g., Bastille, that just help do
proper configuration.
</p>
<p>
There are "secure operating systems" and "trusted operating systems."
Alas, no one can offer technically rigorous definitions for these
terms.  Windows NT, and several of Unix derivatives claimed, over the
years, to be secure and trusted.  For example, we found the following
quote, early 2000s, "Windows NT is a secure operating system but only
if it's configured correctly." Nevertheless, operating systems that
lay claim to either being secure or trusted are better designed and
engineered from their inception with a concern for security.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
The space of hardening a system is vast.  It includes new ideas yet to
be implemented in widely used OS (e.g., Windows, and Linux).  It
includes re-designing and re-implementing existing ideas such as
"change-roots".  It includes analyzing the source code of an OS
extremely carefully by experts as well as via software tools based on
mathematical proof techniques.  The next few sections introduce these
ideas further.

<h3 id="sec-5-1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Careful Recompilation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">


<p>
Stack smashing (buffer overflow) attacks are among the most common.  By
and large, these are programming errors that can be caught by
analytical techniques.  Newer compilers are mechanizing these
techniques.  See the Buffer Overflow Attacks and Development of Software
without Secure Holes  articles.

<h3 id="sec-5-2"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Least Privilege</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">


<p>
On Linux systems, the user called root or super user, with user-id 0,
can bypass (nearly) all security restrictions.  Windows systems have
the "System" and "Administrator" accounts.  The super user privilege
should be split into many smaller privileges.  E.g., a backup process
should be able to read any file, but it should not be able to shut
down the system, modify files, or send network packets.  Processes, not
users, should be given privileges.  The backup process should be
permitted to read all files, even though the root user who invokes the
program should not be allowed such access.  The backup process should
not be able to pass its privileges down to processes that it
starts.  The use of such finely divided abilities instead of sweeping
powerful mechanisms is called the <i>least privilege</i> principle.
</p>
<p>
The traditional Unix model allows for access control of only
files.  So, a number of resources become "files": processes, hard
disks, network interfaces, etc.  In order to apply the principle of
least privilege, we also need to divide the resources into finer units
(often called objects, but unrelated to OOP).  The users and processes
are called subjects.

<h3 id="sec-5-3"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Capabilities</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">


<p>
Capabilities is a word used with different meanings in the context of
OS design.  In OS research literature, processes hold tokens, called
capabilities, denoting resources to be accessed and what can be done
with them.  Capabilities can be explicitly passed among
processes.  Linux, and Windows are not capability based in this
sense.  This usage of the word is unrelated to "POSIX capabilities"
which are implemented in Linux and described later.

<h3 id="sec-5-4"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> Mandatory Access Control</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">


<p>
An OS can control access by attaching <i>sensitivity labels</i> (SLs) to
objects (files, processes, network interfaces, packets, and so on).
E.g., incoming network packets can be assigned SLs, based on the
source IP address or the network interface.  Outgoing packets can have
the label of the process that created them.  A filtering rule can then
be formulated so that packets can be dropped if the SL does not
satisfy some conditions.  When inheritance of privileges is not
assumed, this is known as <i>mandatory access control</i>.

<h3 id="sec-5-5"><span class="section-number-3">5.5</span> Role-Based Access Control</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-5">


<p>
An OS can divide the privileges based on the function ("role") they
have, such as backup, file system integrity check, filtration of
incoming packets.  Each user is permitted a collection of roles.  RBAC
can implement MAC.  There is a considerable amount of discrete
mathematics developed for RBAC and MAC.

<p>
We must always assume that there can be (many unknown) ways of
corrupting a kernel, running processes and loaded libraries.  So kernel
should include an integrity checking system which would check the
integrity of kernel, while running, using crypto algorithms.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-8">


<p>
In spite of file system audits, suppose we have a rogue kernel that
was loaded through the OS loader (such as Grub).  How can we detect?
Similarly, suppose the <code>/sbin/init</code> was replaced.  The conceptual
answer is to mutually authenticate using MD5 and SHA1 sums.

<h3 id="sec-5-9"><span class="section-number-3">5.9</span> Scope of ptrace(2)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-9">


<p>
Through the <code>ptrace(2)</code> system call one process (the "tracer") may
observe and control the execution of another process (the "tracee"),
and examine and change the tracee's memory and registers.  It is
primarily used to implement breakpoint debugging and system call
tracing.  A single user is able to examine the memory and running
state of any of their own processes.  By compromising one
application process, an attacker can attach to other running processes
(a web browser e.g.) to extract credentials and continue to expand the
scope of their attack without resorting to user-assisted phishing.
Since ptrace is not used by non-developers and non-admins, system
builders should disable this debugging system on "normally" deployed
systems.
</p>
<p>
Some applications (e.g., ssh-agent) use <code>prctl(PR-SET-DUMPABLE, ...)</code> to
specifically disallow such ptrace attachment ), but many
do not. A more general solution is to only allow ptrace directly from a
parent to a child process (i.e. direct "gdb EXE" and "strace EXE" still
work), or with CAP-SYS-PTRACE (i.e. "gdb &ndash;pid=PID", and "strace -p PID"
still work as root).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
Whereas the previous section described hardening ideas in general,
this section is a summary of security enhancements of the Linux kernel
that have occurred over the years.  Most of these are now (2013) part
of the officially released Linux kernel source code tree.
</p>
<p>
Many groups offer open source patches to Linux kernel prevent various
attacks.  Each patch has its own limitations and side effects.
Patches released in binary form should in general be not trusted.
Linux patches are source code.  These replace section(s) of code in
the kernel source code tree.  Often a patch is in response to a newly
discovered security hole.  There are proactive modifications also.
Open Wall Linux (<a href="http://www.openwall.com/Owl/">http://www.openwall.com/Owl/</a>), e.g., is a collection
of patches for non-executable stack, temporary file race condition
prevention, restricted proc file system, special handling of file
descriptors 0, 1, 2, destroy shared memory segments not in use,
enforce RLIMITNPROC on execve, and privileged IP aliases.

<p>
POSIX capabilities (Pcaps) can turn a setuid-root file into a file
with minimum privileges, run a daemon with uid=0 but with amost no
superuser privileges, etc.  Privileges are granted to processes
instead of users.    The table

<p>
Pcaps are implemented in Linux kernels since 2.6.x; <code>capsh, getpcaps, getcap, setcap</code> are some of the tools.  E.g., to reduce the privileges
of the nomrallu suid-ed chsh, run <code>chmod u-s /usr/bin/chsh; setcap 0,2,4,7=ep /usr/bin/chsh</code>

<h3 id="sec-6-2"><span class="section-number-3">6.2</span> Linux Namespaces</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">


<p>
A namespace of a process is a collection of "names" associated with
processes and pids, files, volumes, mount table, the network stack
(ports, sockets, interfaces), etc.  A single call <code>unshare(2)</code> creates a
new namespace for the current process (see also <code>man unshare</code>).
</p>
<p>
The following namespaces are available.
</p>
<ol>
<li><code>mount namespace</code> mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect
   rest of the system 

</li>
<li><code>UTS namespace</code> setting hostname, domainname will not affect rest of
   the system

</li>
<li><code>IPC namespace</code> process will have independent namespace for System
   message queues, semaphore sets and shared memory segments

</li>
<li><code>network namespace</code> process will have independent IPv4 and IPv6
   stacks, IP routing tables, firewall rules, the /proc/net and
   /sys/class/net directory trees, sock‐ ets etc.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
As an example use of namespaces, consider routing.  The set of network
interfaces and routing tables are shared across the entire OS and all
processes.  With network namespaces, different and separate instances
of "the network" can be made.
</p>
<p>
The <code>unshare(1)</code> command 
starts a child process with the mount, UTS, IPC or network namespaces
"unshared" from its parent.   The <code>systemd</code> uses mount namespaces for the
ReadWriteDirectories, ReadOnlyDirectories or InaccessibleDirectories
unit configuration options, and for systemd-nspawn.

<h3 id="sec-6-6"><span class="section-number-3">6.6</span> Linux Security Modules (LSM)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-6">


<p>
The Linux Kernel Security Module (LSM) is a kernel framework that
enables many different access control models as loadable kernel
modules.  Currently (2013), the Linux kernel source tree has AppArmor,
SELinux, SMACK, TOMOYO, Yama, and Unix DAC (Discretionary Access
Controls).  LSM may become stackable in future.
</p>
<p>
AppArmor associates assigns a security profile to each program that
restricts the capabilities of that program.  It supplements the
traditional discretionary access control (DAC) model with mandatory
access control (MAC).  Ubuntu uses apparmor by default, and the
profiles are located in <code>/etc/apparmor*</code>
</p>
<p>
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a contribution by the National
Security Agency.  It restricts the actions that programs can take.
AppArmor identifies file system objects by path name instead of inode.
This means that, for example, a file that is inaccessible may become
accessible under AppArmor when a hard link is created to it, while
SELinux would deny access through the newly created hard link.  On the
other hand, data that is inaccessible in SELinux may become accessible
when applications update the file by replacing it with a new version, a
frequently used technique, while AppArmor would continue to deny access
to the data.  In both cases, a default policy of "no access" avoids
the problem.
</p>
<p>
Smack consists of three components: a MAC LSM, a startup script that
ensures that device files have the correct Smack attributes and loads
the Smack configuration, and a set of patches to the GNU Core
Utilities package to make it aware of Smack extended file attributes.
Smack was/is used in the mobile OSs named MeeGo and Tizen.
</p>
<p>
TOMOYO is a name-based MAC LSM, as opposed to inode based security.
"Every process is created to achieve a purpose, and like an
immigration officer, TOMOYO Linux allows each process to declare
behaviours and resources needed to achieve their purpose. When
protection is enabled, TOMOYO Linux acts like an operation watchdog,
restricting each process to only the behaviours and resources allowed
by the administrator." [from TOMOYO's web site]
</p>
<p>
Yama extends DAC support with additional system-wide security
settings.  Currently available is ptrace scope restriction.  Further
information can be found in Documentation/security/Yama.txt.

<p>
Every process has a current working directory that it begins with and
a root directory, which is used to resolve the absolute path names of
files.  By default, the root directory of a process is /.  Chroot system
call changes the directory that is considered the root of a
process.  All subsequent absolute path names of a file are resolved
with respect to the new root.  The process cannot access files that are
outside of the tree rooted at the new root directory, even in the
presence of hard or symbolic links.  Such a process is said to be in a
chroot jail.  Server daemons, such as anonymous FTP server, and web
server, where the processes need only access to a limited sub tree,
are run inside a chroot jail for security reasons.  Unfortunately,
weaknesses exist, and a jailed super user process can break out of
it.  Linux chroot restricts only the real (e.g., persistent storage
media) file system access of the processes in the jail.  Using
interprocess communication mechanisms such as domain sockets, shared
memory segments, and signals, a jailed process can damage the rest of
the system.
</p>
<p>
By exploiting <code>chroot, chdir, fchdir</code> system calls, an attacker with
root privileges can break chroot jail.  None of the three system calls
check to make sure that current working directory (cwd) is within the
root directory of the process.  When a process calls chroot, the root
directory of the process is changed but cwd is left unchanged.  If
process has a directory open, which is outside the root directory, it
can call fchdir to that directory and the cwd of the process changes
to that directory.  Once the cwd goes out of the root directory of the
process, the process is successful in breaking the chroot jail.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-8">


<p>
Grsecurity [Spender 2003] uses the least privilege principle.  Some of
the features of Grsecurity are Trusted Path Execution, Process-based
Mandatory Access Control, Access control lists, chroot restrictions,
randomizing PIDs, IP IDs, TCP initial sequence numbers, and FIFO
restrictions.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, a "trusted path" is one where the parent directory is owned
by root and is neither group nor others writable.  A file is said to
be in the trusted path only if the directory of the file is owned by
root and it has neither group nor others writable permissions.  TPE
works based on an internal list of trusted user ids.  If a given user
tries to execute a file not in the Trusted Path, and their user id is
not in the kernels trusted list, they are denied execution privileges.
This is known as Trusted Path Execution.
</p>
<p>
The RBAC Mandatory Access Control system of grsecurity was the
inspiration for SELinux and AppArmor.  Grsecurity is "coupled" with
PaX in how its source code is distributed.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-14">


<p>
No matter what design enhancements have been made, we should be
prepared for intrusion, and hence must have OS functionality that can
detect things.
</p>
<p>
Linux Intrusion Detection System (LIDS), is a a series of kernel
patches that enable loadable module and mount point locking.  Its
focus is on Access Control Lists.  LIDS features include enhancements
to Linux capabilities, protecting important files, protecting Raw I/O
devices, protecting important processes, and port scan detector at the
kernel level.  
</p>
<p>
Snort is an open source network intrusion prevention and detection
system (IDS/IPS) combining signature, protocol, and anomaly-based
inspection.  "Snort can perform protocol analysis and content
searching/matching. It can be used to detect a variety of attacks and
probes, such as buffer overflows, stealth port scans, CGI attacks, SMB
probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, and much more. It uses a flexible
rules language to describe traffic that it should collect or pass, as
well as a detection engine that utilizes a modular plug-in
architecture. Snort has a real-time alerting capability as well,
incorporating alerting mechanisms for syslog, a user specified file, a
UNIX socket, or WinPopup messages to Windows clients. Snort has three
primary uses: a straight packet sniffer like tcpdump, a packet logger
(useful for network traffic debugging, etc), or a full-blown network
intrusion prevention system." [from <a href="http://www.snort.org/">http://www.snort.org/</a>]

The snort can easily belong in Fortification.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-5">


<p>
The following is a list, based on kernel version 3.12 (Nov 2013), of
the various security related choices you can make using the <code>xconfig</code>
tool in building a custom kernel.  Note that not all items mentioned
in Security Enhancements in the Linux Kernel have made it into the
official kernel source tree.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the security module that will be used by default if the
   kernel parameter <code>security</code> is not specified.  Choices: SELinux
   Simplified Mandatory Access Control (DEFAULT-SECURITY-SMACK) TOMOYO
   (DEFAULT-SECURITY-TOMOYO) AppArmor (DEFAULT-SECURITY-APPARMOR) Yama
   (DEFAULT-SECURITY-YAMA) Unix Discretionary Access Controls
   (DEFAULT-SECURITY-DAC)

</li>
<li>Restrict unprivileged access to the kernel syslog
   (SECURITY-DMESG-RESTRICT) This enforces restrictions on
   unprivileged users reading the kernel syslog via dmesg(8).

</li>
<li>Enable the securityfs filesystem (SECURITYFS) It is currently used
   by the TPM BIOS character driver and IMA, an integrity provider.  It
   is not used by SELinux or SMACK.

</li>
<li>Security hooks for pathname based access control (SECURITY-PATH)

</li>
<li>NSA SELinux Support (SECURITY-SELINUX) You will also need a policy
   configuration and a labeled filesystem.

</li>
<li>Simplified Mandatory Access Control Kernel Support (SECURITY-SMACK)
   Smack is useful for sensitivity, integrity, and a variety of other
   mandatory security schemes.

</li>
<li>TOMOYO Linux Support (SECURITY-TOMOYO) This selects TOMOYO Linux,
   pathname-based access control.

</li>
<li>AppArmor support (SECURITY-APPARMOR) This enables the AppArmor
   security module.  Required userspace tools.  AppArmor policy is
   stored in a set of files in <code>/etc/apparmor.d/</code>.

</li>
<li>Yama support (SECURITY-YAMA) Yama extends discretionary access
   controls (DAC) support with additional system-wide security
   settings beyond regular Linux DAC.

</li>
<li>Digital signature verification using multiple keyrings
   (INTEGRITY-SIGNATURE) It defines separate keyrings for each of the
   different use cases: evm, ima, and modules.  Different keyrings
   improves search performance, but also allow to "lock" certain
   keyring to prevent adding new keys.

</li>
<li>Enables integrity auditing support (INTEGRITY-AUDIT) In addition to
   enabling integrity auditing support, this option adds a kernel
   parameter <code>integrity-audit</code>, which controls the level of integrity
   auditing messages.

</li>
<li>Enable asymmetric keys support (INTEGRITY-ASYMMETRIC-KEYS) This
   option enables digital signature verification using asymmetric
   keys.

</li>
<li>Integrity Measurement Architecture(IMA) (IMA) The Trusted Computing
   Group(TCG) runtime IMA maintains a list of hash values of
   executables and other sensitive system files, as they are read or
   executed.  We can then discover if an attacker manages to change
   the contents of an important system file being measured.  If your
   system has a TPM chip, then IMA also maintains an aggregate
   integrity value over this list inside the TPM hardware, so that the
   TPM can prove to a third party whether or not critical system files
   have been modified.

</li>
<li>Extended Verification Module (EVM) validates security-sensitive
   extended attributes before allowing operations on the files.

</li>
<li>Asymmetric public-key crypto algorithm subtype
   (ASYMMETRIC-PUBLIC-KEY-SUBTYPE) This option provides support for
   asymmetric public key type handling.  If signature generation
   and/or verification are to be used, appropriate hash algorithms
   (such as SHA-1) must be available.  ENOPKG will be reported if the
   requisite algorithm is unavailable.  RSA public-key algorithm
   (PUBLIC-KEY-ALGO-RSA) 
   (X509-CERTIFICATE-PARSER)

    access to any file.  He can also access raw devices and corrupt
    the file system on it.  We should mount important file volumes as
    read-only.  But the ordinary mount cannot securely accomplish that
    because of access to raw devices.  A read-only file system must
    disable file-write system calls and this would also prevent
    modifying file system through raw devices.
