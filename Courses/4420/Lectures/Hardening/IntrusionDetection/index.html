<h1>Intrusion Detection</h1>
<p>As the name implies, the goal of intrusion detection is to be able to
identify if and when an intrusion has occurred. Because we must minimize damage
done by an intruder and are also interested in catching the intruder, we place a
premium on discovering the intrusion as soon as possible -- within seconds, that
is.&nbsp; Intrusion­detection is the logical complement to network firewalls,
extending the security management capabilities of system administrators to
include security audit, monitoring, attack recognition, and response.</p>
<p>Intrusion includes attacks coming from outside the organization as well as
misuse originating inside the organization.&nbsp; Intrusion Detection systems
collect information from a variety of system and network sources, then analyze
the information for signs of intrusion and misuse.&nbsp; Vulnerability
assessment performs rigorous examinations of systems in order to locate problems
that represent security vulnerabilities.</p>
<h2>Integrity Verifiers</h2>
<p>Integrity protection systems detect when critical components have changed,
and assume that the changes must have been due to malicious activity such as
when backdoors have been added to system files.&nbsp; Some well known integrity
verifiers are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>COPS is a collection of programs that each attempt to tackle a different
    problem area of UNIX security such as:&nbsp; file, directory, and device
    permissions/modes; poor passwords; content, format, and security of password
    and group files; the programs and files run in /etc/rc* and cron tab files;
    existence of root-SUID files, their writeability, and whether or not they
    are shell scripts; a CRC check against important binaries or key files to
    report any changes therein; writability of users home directories and
    startup files (.profile, .cshrc, etc.); anonymous ftp setup; unrestricted
    tftp, decode alias in sendmail, SUID uudecode problems, hidden shells inside
    inetd.conf, rexd running in inetd.conf; miscellaneous root checks -- current
    directory in the search path, a &quot;+&quot; in /etc/host.equiv,
    unrestricted NFS mounts, ensuring root is in /etc/ftpusers, etc.; dates of
    CERT advisories vs. key files; and the Kuang expert system. This takes a set
    of rules and tries to determine if your system can be compromised.&nbsp;
    Open source code:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.fish.com/cops/">www.fish.com/cops/</a>
  <li>Tripwire will checksum your system files, and later detect if an intruder
    has made any modifications. Compares new signatures against old signatures
    to detect when files change. Signing algorithms include MD4, MD5, Snefru,
    and Haval. Signatures should be kept on remote server or read-only medium.
    Tripwire is resource-intensive, but the alternative (re-installing your
    system from scratch) is quite costly. You may get <em>Tripwire</em> from <!--

-->

  <li>Tiger is a set of scripts that scan a UNIX system looking for security
    problems. Regularly checks programs and scripts to see if root access could
    be granted. Typical check is for suid programs.&nbsp; <em>Tiger</em> is
    available at <a href="ftp://net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TAMU/">ftp://net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TAMU/</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Log Files</h2>
<p>Extensive system logs must be generated recording all system activity as
these logs will contain evidence of an intrusion that can be discovered at least
after the fact.&nbsp; Here are the most common of these logs.&nbsp; Be aware
that in different Unix variants the location of these files varies.
<ol>
  <li>utmp wtmp files are located either in /etc, /var/log or /var/run.&nbsp;
    The utmp file logs data regarding currently logged in users.&nbsp; The wtmp
    file records all logins, logouts, shutdown and reboots.&nbsp; For more
    details, man utmp and also see standard include file &lt;utmp.h&gt;.</li>
  <li>The directory /var/log/ records logs from a variety of services.</li>
</ol>
<p>On systems that must be secure, the standard logs and directories such as
/etc and /var/log are not good enough.&nbsp; One must employ additional logging
tools.&nbsp; E.g., who is connecting to services on your system? There are many
programs under the heading of IP loggers available.
<p>It is important that the log files are not stored on the system that
generates the logs.&nbsp; Attackers have been able to edit these.&nbsp; They
have also deliberately caused harmless activity that generated so much logging
that the disks become full before attempting malicious actions.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Analysis of Log Files</h3>
<p>But, these logs are often so large that is hard for the average person to
analyze and manage. There are programs that can be searched under the phrase
&quot;log file analysis&quot; that examine the logs systematically and alert you
to suspicious activity.</p>
<h2>Sniffers</h2>
<p>Traffic sniffers are a double edged sword. They can be used to track the
communications of intruders in wonderful detail, but they can also be used to
sniff passwords and other sensitive information. You should be very careful in
your use of these powerful programs. The machines running these programs should
as hardened as possible.
<h2>Intrusion Detection Systems</h2>
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become a major area of research and
product development.&nbsp; They are predicated on the assumption that an
intruder can be detected through an examination of various parameters such as
network traffic, CPU utilization, I/O utilization, user location, and various
file activities. IDSs designed to protect networks typically monitor network
activity, while IDSs designed for single hosts typically monitor operating
system activity. System monitors or daemons convert observed parameters into
chronologically sorted records of system activities. Called &quot;audit
trails,&quot; these records are analyzed by IDSs for unusual or suspect
behavior. IDS approaches include
<h3>Signature analysis</h3>
<p>Specific signatures or patterns characterize attack attempts. Semantic
descriptions or signatures of known attacks are collected or formulated and
stored in a database.&nbsp; One type of signature analysis, audit trail
analysis, compares information found in the audit trails, e.g., a system's built­in
audit log or event log, with the attack signatures. Attack scenarios might be
translated into sequences of audit events, or into patterns of data that can be
sought in the audit trail generated by the operating system of a computer, by
router software, firewalls, switches, or applications. Other patterns or
sequences may be found in a stream of network traffic. When a sequence of events
is found in the audit trail, or in the network traffic, that matches a sequence
of audit events, or the signature of an attack, an attempt of an intrusion is
suspected.</p>
<p>The main drawback of the signature analysis technique -- like all misuse­based
approaches -- is the need for frequent updates to keep up with the stream of new
vulnerabilities/attacks discovered, this situation is aggravated by the
requirement to represent all possible facets of the attacks as signatures in a
signature database.</p>
<h3>Rule-Based Intrusion Detection</h3>
Rule-based intrusion detection (RBID)assumes that intrusion attempts can be
characterized by sequences of user activities that lead to compromised system
states. RBID systems are characterized by their expert system properties that
fire rules when audit records or system status information begin to indicate
illegal activity. These predefined rules typically look for high-level state
change patterns observed in the audit data compared to predefined penetration
state change scenarios. Audit events are translated into facts carrying their
semantic signification in the expert system, and the intrusion analysis function
draws conclusions using these rules and facts either to detect the presence of a
suspected attack or to detect inconsistent behavior. This method increases the
abstraction level of the audit data by attaching semantics to it. If an RBID
expert system infers that a penetration is in process or has occurred, it will
alert the computer system security officers and provide them with both a
justification for the alert and the user identification of the suspected
intruder.&nbsp; Note that the rule base must be continually updated to
accommodate new descriptions of attacks or new usage patterns.
<p>There are two major approaches to rule-based intrusion detection:
<ol>
  <li><em>State-based</em>. In this approach, the rule base is codified using
    the terminology found in the audit trails. Intrusion attempts are defined as
    sequences of system state- as defined by audit trail information- leading
    from an initial, limited access state to a final compromised state.
  <li><em>Model-based</em>. In this approach, known intrusion attempts are
    modeled as sequences of user behavior; these behaviors may then be modeled,
    for example, as events in an audit trail. The IDS determines how an
    identified user behavior may manifest itself in an audit trail. Model based
    systems can process more data, because the technology allows you to narrow
    the focus of the data selectively, allow more intuitive explanations of
    intrusion attempts, and can&nbsp; predict the intruder's next action.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rule­based description languages form natural tools for modeling the
knowledge that experts have collected about attacks. This approach allows a
systematic browsing of the audit trail in search of evidence of attempts to
exploit known vulnerabilities. They are also used for verifying the proper
application of the security policy of an organization. The main limitations of
this approach are 1) the difficulty of extracting knowledge about attacks and 2)
the processing speed.</p>
<h3>State­transition analysis</h3>
<p>This technique describes an attack with a set of goals and transitions, but
represents them as state­transition diagrams. States in the attack pattern,
corresponding to system states, have Boolean assertions associated with them
that must be satisfied to transition to that state. This approach is
conceptually identical to model­based reasoning.<br>
</p>
<h3>Statistical-Based Intrusion Detection</h3>
The most widely used approach of anomaly­based intrusion detection is
statistical. User or system behavior is measured by a number of variables
sampled over time and stored in a profile. There are several types of measures
in a profile. These types include: Activity intensity measures; Audit record
distribution measures; Categorical measures (e.g., relative frequency of
logins); Ordinal measures (e.g., a number value of an amount of CPU or I/O for a
specific user). The current behavior of each user is maintained in a profile. At
regular intervals the current profile is merged with the stored profile.
Anomalous behavior is determined by comparing the current profile with the
stored profile. The original model keeps averages of all these variables and
detects whether thresholds are exceeded based on the standard deviation of a
variable. More complex models have been developed which compare profiles of long­term
and short­term user activities. The profiles are regularly updated as the
behaviors of users evolve.
<p>SBID assumes that intrusions can be detected by inspecting a system's audit
trail data for unusual activity, and that an intruder's behavior will be
noticeably different from that of a legitimate user. Before unusual activity can
be detected, SBID systems require a characterization of user or system activity
that is considered &quot;normal.&quot; These characterizations, called <em>profiles</em>,
are typically represented by sequences of events that may be found in the
system's audit data. Any sequence of system events deviating from the expected
profile by a statistically significant amount is flagged as an intrusion
attempt. The main advantage of SBID systems is that intrusions can be detected
without <em>a priori</em> information about the security flaws of a system.</p>
<p>SBID systems typically employ statistical anomaly and rule-based misuse
models. System profiles, user profiles, or both may be used to define expected
behavior. User profiles, if used, are specific to each user and are dynamically
maintained. As a user's behavior changes over time, so too will his user
profile. No such profiles are used in RBID systems. As is the case with RBID
systems, known intrusion scenarios can be codified into the rule base of SBID
systems.
<p>Detection of specific denial­of­service attacks that make use of weaknesses
in the Internet protocol suite can be subsumed under the statistical approach.
One example is the SYN flood attack where an attacker sends many connection
requests with a forged source IP address and requires the attacked system to
acknowledge these requests without finally receiving a confirmation. Though the
attacker seems to behave according to the communications protocol, the attack
can only be detected by the quantity of connection requests received within a
certain period of time. The quantity of requests together with the configured
number of allowed open connections define the threshold for this type of attack.</p>
<h3>Neural networks</h3>
<p>Neural networks are algorithms that learn about the relationship between
input­output vectors and ''generalize'' them to obtain new input­output
vectors in a reasonable way. The main use of neural networks for intrusion
detection is to learn the behavior of actors in the system (e.g., users,
daemons). The advantage of using neural networks over statistics resides in
having a simple way to express nonlinear relationships between variables, and in
learning/retraining the neural network automatically. Neural networks are still
a computationally intensive technique, and are not widely used in the intrusion
detection community.<br>
</p>
<h3>User anomalous behavior identification</h3>
<p>This technique models the normal or authorized behavior of users by the set
of tasks they have to or are authorized to perform on the system. These tasks
and facets of the system's security policy are then represented as patterns for
users' expected or authorized actions such as access to particular files or
types of files. These actions are related to the audited or logged events, e.g.
security related events, which are observed and recorded by the system. The
analyzer keeps a set of tasks or patterns that each user should or may perform.
Then by comparing, either real­time or off­line, the individuals' actions
found in the audit trails with their desired or authorized patterns and they do
not fit the task pattern an alarm is issued. This method is similar to signature
analysis except that the inspection expects the actions to match the pattern for
proper activity and when it fails to match it signals suspected improper
activity, while in signature analysis the inspection expects the activity to not
match the pattern (signature) for improper activity and when it matches an
attempt at intrusion is suspected.<br>

<h2>The Linux Intrusion Detection System</h2>
<p>LIDS (<a href="http://www.lids.org/">http://www.lids.org/</a>) an intrusion
detection/defense system in Linux kernel.&nbsp; It modifies the Linux kernel
sources which enhances the kernel's security. When it is in effect, chosen files
access, all system/network administration operations, any capability use, raw
device, mem, and I/O access can be made impossible even for root.&nbsp; </p>
