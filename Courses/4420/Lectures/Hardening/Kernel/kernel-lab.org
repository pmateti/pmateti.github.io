* Background

1. Prerequisite:: SysCalls: Done in a separate lab.

* Tasks

** Task: Examples of Kernel Bugs [25 points]

1. Position Independent Code

** Task: Kernel Build by LLVM

1. Unit tests for known LLVM Linux Bugs 

** Task:
** Task:

* Tasks: [Bonus][Optional]

* Submission

1. For Fall 2018, this is lab Lx numbered x.  Substitute below.
1. Lab Lx Grading Sheet is superseded by this document.  Point
   assignments are shown in brackets.  There are bonus points for a
   "job well done" even if you skipped the bonus tasks.

1. You must follow the Lab Report Template. There should be a section
   on each of the tasks, and subsections on sub-tasks.  Include a
   couple of lines of an answer to each (implied/ explicit) question/
   discussion item.  Must number it as in this document.

1. Use good judgement and do not make the report way longer than, say,
   20 pages. Submit explanations and code that verifies your answers.

1. Include a journal.  By the hour.

1. This lab requires revisions of a few given source code
   files. Include the revised versions in Lx.tbz.

1. Submit a PDF file named exactly =Report-Lx.pdf=, and a tarball
   =Lx.tbz= [use =tar cfjvv Lx.tbz source-files*= ]. (Scripts are used
   to check various things -- so file names should obey such "rules".)
