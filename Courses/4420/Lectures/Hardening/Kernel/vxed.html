One of the main problem with UNIX security is that super user can do
with system anything he wants.  There are programs (daemons) which work
with super user privileges, for example popd, sendmail, and accessible
from network (Internet/Intranet).   There are bugs in many of these
programs.  An intruder connects to such programs via network, exploits
existing bugs in it and gets control over all of the
host.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman"&gt; "VXE
creates virtual environment for each subsystem.  In such environment
only needed for normal work resources are visible and available for
subsystem.   Subsystem here, is startup program and all sub processes
initiated (forked) by it.  Any sub process runs in the same VXE that
the parent.  To affect any system resources, program use OS system
calls (syscalls).  VXE has means to describe what system calls, with
what parameters are available for each subsystem.  For example, it can
be described (for file operation syscalls) that some files are
readable and some executable, network operations unavailable (in case
of POP server - it handle network connection, but doesn't make new
ones) and this restrictions can't be broken even by a program with
super user privileges.   These restrictions can be as smart as
needed.  If intruder gets a control over such subsystems, he can't use
ordinary methods to sniff information or affect the system.  Everything
he can do in theory, using sophisticated methods, - is to affect the
work of hacked subsystem, but not OS itself, nor another subsystems.
Here, ordinary methods, are those, when intruder gets super user
privileges and runs command interpreter (shell), and ordinary
utilities, such as text editor, copy utility and so on.  He can't do
anything without such utilities.  For example, POP server doesn't need
text editor and copy utility for it's work, so there is no such
programs in VXE environment, created for POPD protection.   More
exactly, VXE protects system and it's subsystems from interference of
hacked subsystem (which works under the control of VXE).  And as side
effect, provides protection of subsystem itself (in a way described
above).  For simplicity, in the following text, we will say that VXE
protects subsystem.   VXE description (VXED) is small LISP program (set
of functions) which use declarative description of acceptable
parameters for different system calls.   This VXED loaded to the
kernel, controls system calls parameters from the specified
subsystem.  So VXEDs are dynamically loadable modules, handled by the
small LISP interpreter, inserted into the kernel.  In current VXE
version, this is vxelisp, derived from RefLisp (Bill Birch &lt;font
face="Times New Roman,Times,Times NewRoman"
color="#0000ff"&gt;&lt;u&gt;birchb@ozemail.com.au&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/font&gt;).   vxelisp has new
internal bigstring representation, full set of string and bit
functions.  Kernel version of vxelisp is reentrant, to handle different
VXEDs simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
There are two methods to activate VXED.  Explicit and implicit (automatic).
Explicit activation is done by vxe program.  Parameters are VXED pathname,
path and parameters of executable, which will be run with restrictions,
described in named VXED.  For automatic method, vxed utility preloads all
needed VXEDs into the kernel.  Each VXED has activation pattern.  During program
start (exec), kernel checks executable path against patterns.  VXED with matching
pattern is activated.  This method can be used, to activate protection at the
start of any program in specified directory (and all subdirectories).  For
example, to protect system from CGI scripts, supplied by users, VXEDs can be
defined for each user subdirectory.
Any sophisticated VXED can be created manually, using full power of vxelisp.
But VXE doesn't force administrator to learn and use LISP.  One can think about
VXE as of self-learning system.  VXE development system (DS) runs VXE in trace
mode.
Such run makes description of permitted (used) system calls.  Creation and
modification of VXED is made via WWW interface.  Development system supports two
types of VXED.  Strict and filesystem types.  Strict VXED describes all permitted
syscalls explicitly.  Filesystem VXED describes read, write, and execute
permissions for defined paths.  Specified restrictions apply to filesystem
syscalls, all other syscalls are permitted.  After VXED has been created for
particular subsystem, VXED works in soft mode.  In this mode all violations of
VXED are logged, but syscalls are performed.  VXE DS can upgrade VXED
automatically, using logged information.
Surely, needed changes in VXED can be done manually using VXED editor.
Violations can be caused by intruder activity or by deviation in subsystem's
behavior under various circumstances.  VXE administrator reviews log with the
help of DS and makes decision, if upgrade is reasonable.  If there are no
violations, VXED can be switched to production mode.  In this mode violations are
logged and syscalls are blocked (fail).  Once again, the log can be used for
intruder detection or for VXED upgrade (tuning).
For security reasons, all control actions over VXE can be done only by super
user and outside any VXE.
VXE affects performance in following ways.  If program runs outside any VXE,
every syscall executes two assembler instructions more (checks if VXE is in
effect for current process and jump if no).  For every exec syscall a small C
subroutine checks if there is a matching VXED already available in the kernel.
For programs that run in VXE, a few lines of C code checks if parameter
verification is needed.  Some syscalls can be marked in VXED as uncheckable (for
example, by default, read and write operations).  And only the rest syscalls are
checked by very small LISP functions.  These functions located in VXED and can be
easily observed by administrator.
Two types of VXED are two security policy models.  New models can be
implemented without any changes in the kernel.  "
