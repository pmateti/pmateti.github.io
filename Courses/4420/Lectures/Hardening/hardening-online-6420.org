These are notes to [[http://www.wright.edu/~pmateti][myself]] and [[chris.roberts@wright.edu][Chris Roberts]] as we prepare to produce
the lecture videos.  Expected video length of this "chapter": 60
minutes.  Each line item below is worth between 30 sec to 2 minutes.

Abstract: We distinguish /hardening/ a system from proper
/configuration/ and /fortification/.  Hardening, in our definition,
refers to areas of security tightening during the design and
construction of systems rather than after their deployment.  Carefully
adjusting various parameters after an out-of-the-box install is
configuration.  Installing or uninstalling various packages using the
OS native tools and mechanisms, such as apt-get in Debian/ Ubuntu,
is fortification.  For further elaboration, read the 
[[..//Config/config-online-6420.html][Proper Configuration]]
article/video.

* Ideas of OS Hardening
1. Ideas applicable to all OS
** Careful Recompilation
** Least Privilege
** Capabilities
** Mandatory Access Control
** Role-Based Access Control
** Enhanced Authentication
** Logging
** Source Code Review
* Pruning the Kernel
1. Building a custom kernel with just the needed components
   1. Pruning device drivers, file systems, ...
1. Disable Loadable Kernel Modules (LKM)
   1. =/boot/vmlinuz= has all the "modules" merged in
   1. =/lib/modules/this-version-of-kernel= will be empty

* Linux Kernel Enhancements

** POSIX capabilities
** Chroot restrictions
** SE Linux
** LIDS (Linux Intrusion Detection System) 
** grsecurity
** AppArmor
** Address space modification protection
* Lab Experiment

* Required and Recommended Reading


* Educational Objectives

Understand hardening in contrast to proper configuration and fortification of a system.
Become familiar with what makes and OS trusted and/or secure.
