<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Project Overview/ Goals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Enahancing/ Correcting existing code is the daily grind for a
software engineer. One should learn to engineer software so that
it is easy to carry this out.  A complementary skill is to know
when to treat a portion of code as black box, and when to treat it
as a transparent box.
</li>

<li>Overview of <a href="../Lectures/Maintenance">software maintenance</a>.  Our team project will typically
be to take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> project, that is/was quite popular, and improve
it.  Last two terms we did fresh projects.
</li>

<li>Every student, especially, graduate students, of software
engineering should study the spec/ design/ implementation of 10+
KLOC programs.  How deeply? Depends on individual ability and
available time.  Unfortunately, well-known open source projects do
not [care to] produce spec/design documents.  We hope to fill this
gap.
</li>

<li>Careless thinking causes bugs. Can you see this carelessness in the
code of our chosen project?  What portion can we attribute to
design? to spec? to requirements?
</li>

<li>Official contributions to the FOSS project are certainly welcome,
but this is not a "graded" goal.
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Teams</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Project work in this course is done by small teams.  Form
into teams of three people.  I will be willing to adjust the
"quantity" of work if you could not form into a team of three.
</li>

<li>Even so, there are no lectures on "team work".
</li>

<li>Choose your team mates carefully.  We have seen teams losing
members midway through the term.
</li>

<li>It is your responsibility to bring to my attention when some team
member is not contributing equally.
</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You will be given the name of a FOSS project. It would have been
written in C/C++/ Java.  Download the open source code, latest
version, build it and use it well enough to understand its
capabilities.
</li>

<li>This collection of src code files is a starting point of the
software project for this course.  It is complex enough that we
could not have developed it, during this semester, if we started
afresh to design and build it.  We hope to contribute to the
project at-large the various missing pieces that a class room
software engineering project expects to be there &#x2013; e.g., the
various documents.
</li>

<li>You will be expected to use tools such as Intellij Idea, Eclipse,
git, make, ant, gradle, JML, KeY, and others introduced in the next
few weeks.
</li>

<li>There are 6 tech reports (Requirements, Specifications, Design,
Implementation, Testing, and Final Report), 5% each, due at various
stages of the project.  The due dates are/ will-be on the course
home page.
</li>

<li>This is not a course on Technical Writing.  Nevertheless, all
project documents submitted are expected to be technical reports
(TRs).  Even if you are not a thesis/dissertation student, read
these pages: <a href="http://www.wright.edu/graduate-school/graduate-thesis-and-dissertation-handbook-procedures">wright.edu/ graduate- thesis -and- dissertation-
handbook- procedures</a>.
</li>

<li>Each of you should maintain a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Daily-Journal">journal</a>.  Include the journals of all
your team members in every TR as an Appendix.
</li>

<li>Peer reviews.  Each of you is expected to critique the documents
submitted by another group.  So that this is really useful, the
critique should be submitted within a week of receiving the
document.  We will workout further details in class.
</li>

<li>The numbers inside parens are weights.  This number is also the
maximum possible score for that item.  These max numbers may add up
to &gt; 100.  The Score Earned per each of the six phases is
computed as follows: (Sum of the Item Scores Earned)/(Sum of the
Item Max Scores)*100.
</li>

<li>Due dates are announced on the course home page.  Late penalty is
5% per day late, Sat and Sun counted.  Five days after the due date
no submission is accepted.  If you have a special situation,
discuss it before, not afterwards.  Late submissions due to
computer systems being glitchy, etc. are forgiven.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
A Requirements Document describes the software project at its
conception.  It is written from the users perspective.  In fact, it is
good idea to actually write a first draft of a Users Manual and
include it as an appendix.  It justifies why it is worthwhile to do
it.  Unless the project topic is well known, such as editors,
compilers, etc., it should expalin where it is coming from.

<h3 id="sec-5-1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Modeling the Problem Domain</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
A major goal is to clarify the "things" that the project deals with.
</p>

<p>
[not 2017] In this course, we will almost always be starting from the
source code of an already implemented project.  So, we pretend that it
is yet to be constructed.
</p>

<p>
[For 2017 Batch Rename PDF files] Our problem domain "Rename Academic
Papers" is moderately ill-defined.  For example, what are
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The subject classification.
</li>
<li>The year of publication.
</li>
<li>List of author names (First Middle Last).
</li>
<li>Names of conference or journal of publication.
</li>
<li>Names of a file.
</li>
<li>Obviously these are strings of ASCII characters.  Beyond that do
we a clear understanding?
</li>
<li>notion of accurate re-naming
</li>
<li>Qualitative or quantitative ("how much") controls the client
desires

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
In large projects, requirements elicitation is a major and difficult
task.  Often requirements become clearer after a prototype has been
built.

Related terms: Requirements Definition, Requirements Specification,
Requirements Elicitation, Requirements Analysis.

<p>
We cannot really give a template as requirements depend on the given
project.  Marsic's book has an example as an appendix.  Do a web
search for examples.  There are some decent answers on
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a>.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>All of you must address the items below in your Requirements
Document.  Some of these are subjective &#x2013; make them as objective
as possible.
</li>

<li>(40) There was no Requirements Document written for Our Project by
its authors.  Pretending that Project implementation does not exist
yet, write this document addressing existing features and the items
discussed in this section.
</li>

<li>(20) Describe an improved GUI look-and-feel.
</li>

<li>(20) [not 2017] Develop a new and useful feature/ improvement/ plugin.  It is
expected that different teams will propose different things.
</li>

<li>(20) Describe code maintainablity expectations.
</li>
<li>(20) Describe the expectations of "By the end of Testing Phase"
(see Testing section).
</li>

<li>(20) [not 2017] Of course, Our Project is already designed and built.  A
goal that is imposed on you is 5% code reduction.  If this is not
doable, it is your responsibility to convince me and your peer reviewers.
</li>

<li>(30) Journals of your team members.
</li>
<li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.
</li>
<li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the Requirements
documents submitted by another group.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>(50) There was no Specifications Document written for Our Project by
its authors.  Pretending that Project implementation does not
exist yet, write this document addressing existing features and
the items listed in Requirements.
</li>
<li>(20) Acceptance/Conformance tests are part of a Spec.
</li>
<li>(20) Rigor and mathematical logic.
</li>
<li>(10) Suppose our project is an Editor.  Every modern text editor
has buffers, cursors, view-windows, cut-paste-containers, kbd +
mouse input methods, undo/redo, &#x2026; What are the essential pieces
to Our Project this term?  Did this doc describe their spec? What
are the essential pieces to Our Project this term?
</li>
<li>(20) Quality of the spec of 5% code reduction.  Objectively
stated? Subjective? Can it be verified through some tools?
</li>

<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>(20) There was no Design Document written for Our Project by its
authors.  You are extracting &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; design of Project from
its existing implementation in Java in the absence of Req, Spec,
and Design documents by Project 's authors. 
</li>

<li>It is not enough that you feel you understood the design of the
core of Project well enough.  You need to articulate it in the
submitted doc. 
</li>

<li>(20) Having used Our Project for a week or so, a fellow
developer is now interested in understanding how it is
designed. (S)he already finished reading your Req and Specs, and
is now reading your Design Doc.  Suppose our project is an Editor.
Assume that (s)he also knows about how editors are typically
designed: buffers, cursors, etc. How well does reading your
document help?  Similarly, assume that (s)he is generally familiar
with the class of programs that Our Projects belongs.  How well
does your doc cater to this need?
</li>

<li>(10) The design of Your "Plugin".  This is new and yours. So
more detail and precision, compared to other sections of this doc,
is expected.  Carefully chosen pseudo code, diagrams, etc. are
expected.  The meaning of "plugin" is now well-known; e.g., as in
Eclipse or IntelliJ plugins.
</li>

<li>(10) Redesign the GUI so it is more familiar/ better.
</li>

<li>(05) Is the goal of 5% code reduction being attempted
through re-design or re-coding? Is it described well-enough?  
</li>

<li>(05) Do a code review of the existing code.  Report on redesign
and re-coding for maintainability.  Keeping Project's Java code
up-to-date with the latest Java belongs in your Implementation
report. 
</li>

<li>(20) Design by Contract should/must be practiced in this
doc. This is not just a question of math logic formalism.  It is
about complete, and precise (-enough) descriptions, perhaps in
English.  Include (strong enough) class invariants.  E.g., what
properties do the views maintained by Project have? Such as: a view
displays a portion of the content of a buffer; the &amp;quot;dot&amp;quot;
cursor is within the view; the buffer is the (modified) content of
a (an existing) file.
</li>

<li>(30) Journals of your team members.
</li>
<li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.
</li>

<li>How are the various pieces of design 
(sections in this document) relate to previous documents? 
</li>

<li>Even in the presence of all kinds of diagrams, pseudo code of
core methods must be present in a design doc.  Choosing an
almost-Java notation defeats the purpose, even though we cannot
give a general rule about how high its level should be. 
</li>
<li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
Design documents submitted by another group.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There was no Implementation Report written for  Project

lists.
</li>

<li>(20) Describe Project implementation not only as it exists, but
also including the code modifications that you have made so that
it is now more compliant with the latest Java, more maintainable,
and reduced in size.  Describe also the implementation of Your
Plugin.  You are welcome to use tools such as Doxygen.
</li>

<li>(20) Include in your turnin a tar-ball of all source code.
It should build cleanly.  Do the equivalent of "make clean"
and then include an "ls -lR" style listing of files.  It
should include a How To Build section.  Include size details
of the system built.
</li>

<li>(30) The implementation of Your Plugin: This is new and yours.
Include details beyond what was in Design Report.  Do not
duplicate &#x2013; just cite the Design Report sections.
</li>

<li>(10) Include in this TR a short report of a "smoke test."  Other
testing such as Unit and Integration Testing are part of the
Test Report.

<h2 id="sec-9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> Testing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There was no Testing Document written for Our Project by its
authors, apart from the bug reports in forums and email lists.
</li>

<li>This report documents the testing performed on our project, as
revised by you.  At a minimum, we expect it to report on (i) a
smoke test that assures that it is not wholly broken, (ii) a
black-box acceptance testing, (iii) a few stress tests that take
the software to its limits, and (iv) several white-box tests of
the internal units that are in the software.  We also expect to
read a statement of code coverage.  This report should always
describe, at some length, all tests that cause failures.  Recall
that (the state of software engineering is such that) we find most
software useful even after knowing it fails.
</li>

<li>Acceptance/Conformance tests are/were part of a Spec.
</li>

<li>Unit and Integration Testing should/must be practiced and reported
in this part of the project work.
</li>

<li>Before using this section as a check list, please review the
CS7140 lectures on Testing and also a chapter or two from a
software engineering (academic) text book (no matter what
amazon.com reviews might say).  Recall Dijkstra's quote: "Testing
shows the presence, not the absence of bugs".  Another: "Absence
of evidence does not imply evidence of absence."
</li>

<li>(10 points) Having used Our Project for a week or so, a fellow
developer is impressed.  (S)he is wondering if Our Project should
be added to her/his tool chest based on reading your "test
report". How well does reading your document help?
</li>

<li>(10) Interactive programs, such as modern text editors, can be
black-box tested treating them as servers and developing a
test-client that feeds test inputs.  "Typing/Mousing" such inputs
is just too tedious.  [We skipped this topic in past CS7140.]  So,
do what you can based on your intuition, reading the bug reports,
email lists, and what you may have learned in a prerequisite
course.
</li>

<li>(30) Unit testing (JUnit or TestNG) of selected classes (2
files/student) of Our Project.  Recall that Home Work 2 permits
the work you did there to be included here.
</li>

<li>(30) The testing of Your Plugin: This is new and
yours. Carefully chosen black-box tests, JUnit/TestNG white-box
tests (of all classes of this plugin), and code coverage tests are
expected.
</li>

<li>(10) Include snapshots so that the redesigned GUI is seen
to be more familiar/ better.
</li>

<li>By the end of Testing Phase:
&lt;ol type=i&gt;
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>(30) Discover and fix at least one bug (not found by any one
else) per team member (or throw in your claim that Project is
bug-free).
</li>
<li>(20) Improve the maintainability of Project.  Describe as many of
these improvements as possible.  During the semester, we will
discuss several subtopics of maintenance.
</li>
<li>(20) Reduce Project code size. It should be at least 5% smaller (as
measured through the .class files) than what it is now. Please
look up on how to measure byte code size from class files ignoring
all meta data.  The reduction in size is excluding the code of
Your Plugin.
