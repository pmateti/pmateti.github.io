<h1>Home Work 2</h1>

<p>[This was for last semester.  For this semester, it will be
modified.  Real Soon Now.]

<p>Home work in this course is done individually, without help from
others.  The homework will be given piece meal and it is expected that
you will work on them as and when given without waiting for a due
date.  The due date is announced on the course home page.

<ol>

<li> (25 points) [Literate Programming] Reconsider the OO revision
  (yours or someone else's with their permission) of the C++ Wiggly
  Worms of <a href="http:./7140-homework-1.html"> Homework1</a>.
  Express it as a literate program (LP).  If you wish, (i) start from
  scratch, use your own design, but with essentially the same visual
  effect and functionality, (ii) rewrite it in a different language of
  your choice (Java, Python, ...).  However, the LP version should
  exemplify the OOP design by contract principles.  Recall that an LP
  author presents it in an order that suits the explanation of the
  program to fellow software engineers, not necessarily in the order
  that a compiler may expect it.

  <p>You may use any of the LP tools: 
    <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/"> noweb</a>, 
    <a href="http://nuweb.sourceforge.net/"> nuweb</a>, cweb,
    <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Intent"> intent</a>,
    <a href="http://lep.sourceforge.net/"> lep</a> (Eclipse plugin),
    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/nano-lp/"> nano-lp</a>, ...;
    some of these are ready to <tt>apt-get install</tt> packages in
    Debian/Ubuntu distros.  
    Visit <a href="http:// www. literateprogramming. com/">

    Professor Emeritus Donald Knuth, "fastest pen in the West", Turing
    Award Winner 199x TBD, developer of
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX"> TeX</a>
    typesetting system, has several
    example <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html">
    programs to read</a>.
    His "Programming Pearls, Literate Programming: The
      Common Words Problem",
    <a href="http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/~fasiha/Papers/CommACM-Programming-Pearls-Knuth-Bentley-v29-n5-1986.pdf"> PDF</a>,
      1986 was a Required Reading.

<li> (25 points) [JML] This part of the home work is focussed on
  gaining experience with the use of JML by practicing on the source
  code of the Game of Life that you studied
  in <a href="http:./7140-homework-1.html"> Homework1</a>.  Thoroughly
  document at least two files, non-trivial, and intersting-to-you,
  using JML assertions (i.e., invariant, requires, ensures,
  assignable, ...).  Recall that we want the weakest requires, and the
  strongest ensures and invariants.

<p>
  Use a JML Plugin (in Eclipse, or Intellij Idea) or a command line
 JML tool to runtime assertion check (RAC) the Game of Life.  There
 are several JML plugins that you can discover through a web search;
 e.g., <a href="http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/openjml-updatesite">
 http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/openjml-updatesite</a> It is useful
 to this class if you all try different JML plugins and report on your
 experience.


<li> (25 points) [JUnit or TestNG] This part of the home work is
  focussed on systematic testing.  You are welcome to use any two
  jEdit class files, non-trivial, and intersting-to-you, as test
  targets.  Members of a team must of course select different jEdit
  classes.  You are welcome to include the results of this Homework2
  in the Testing and Debugging Report of the course project.

<p>
  Use a JUnit Plugin or a TestNG plugin (in Eclipse, or Intellij
  Idea).  The latest versions of these IDE already have these test
  plugins installed.

<li> (25 points) [FindBugs Plugin] This part of the home work is
  focussed on gaining experience with the use of a static analysis of
  source code tool named 
  <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">
    FindBugs</a>. See also, 
  <a href="http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=3847">
    http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=3847</a>.  You are welcome
  to use any two jEdit class files, non-trivial, and
  intersting-to-you, as targets.  Examine closely the reports produced
  by the FindBugs tool.  Which of the items do you agree with?  How
  did you resolve it?


<li> (00 points) Please maintain a journal for this homework.  Submit
  a summary.
</ol>

<p>This Homework2 is <b>now complete</b>.</p>


<p>Turn in your answers as a tar ball (or a zip).
  On <tt>gandalf.cs.wright.edu</tt> invoke <tt>~pmateti/cs7140/turnin
  Homework2 tarBallName</tt> Include the source code files so that
  everything builds cleanly.  Other than the source code files,
  put <b>everything else</b>, including diagrams, screen shots,
  together and produce one .pdf file.
