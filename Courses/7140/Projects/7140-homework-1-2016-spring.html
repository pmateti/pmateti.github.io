<h1>Home Work: HW1 Spring 2016</h1>

<p>Home work in this course is done individually, without help from
  others.  The due date is announced on the course home page.  In this
  HW1, we are focussed on Design by Contract and further use of
  Assertions.

  <ol>
    <li> (50 points) [Improve OOD] [C++] The file
      <a href="../Lectures/Examples/Worms/worms-one-file.cpp.html">
        worms.cpp</a> implements a grass roots game example of wiggly worms,
      scissor heads, cannibals, or vegetarian kind, moving about.
      Additional Notes: Visit the pages
      at <a href="../Lectures/Examples/Worms/">
      ../Lectures/Examples/Worms/
      </a>.

      <ol  type=i>
        <li>
          Revise it so that it is in "proper" OOP form.
        <li>
          It probably has bugs.  Feel free to ignore its bugs (that is you
          are not expected to fix bugs).  If you can, identify them!
        <li>
          Write entry- and exit-assertions for all the methods, and
          class invariants.  You may ignore assertions relating
          to <tt>ncurses.h</tt>.
        <li>The design and code-as-given does not "really" do anything
          about the z-axis.  Suggest ideas and implement.
        <li>
          Write one or two paragraphs reporting on
          how you discovered and revised the classes, and on your experience
          with the tools you used to carry out this assignment.
      </ol>

<li>(50 points) [Java8] [JavaFX] [Threads] [Testing] Read about the Game of
  Life by Conway on the wikipedia.
  <ol  type=i>
    <li> Design and implement in Java an elegant looking GoL program.
      Google Play has several Android APKs.  Use the source code of
      <a href="http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/"> www.bitstorm.org/
      gameoflife/</a>.  Or not.
    <li>
      Write entry- and exit-assertions for all (well, longer
      than 10 lines) the methods, and all class invariants.
    <li> Many GoL programs fail to implement the game properly.
      Particularly, the concurrency and the infinite grid parts.  How do
      we devise a test plan to check that well-known example patterns
      are done right?  Present an executable solution.
    <li>
      Outline a rigorous (executable?) specification that every GoL
      program should satisfy.
    <li>
      Must build cleanly with the latest Java8 + JavaFX.  Note that
      Java9 is around the corner.
</ol>
<li>(25 points Bonus) The worms program did not use threads. Make the
  best of threads to improve the "look and feel" and revise your
  answers to (i) through (v).
<li>
  (00 points) Please maintain a journal for this homework.  Submit a
   summary.

</ol>
<h3>Turn In</h2>
<p>
Follow all ethical/ scholary traditions of attribution.
<p>
  Include screenshots.  Other than the source code files, put
  everything else together and produce <b>one</b> PDF
  file.

<p>The file hw1.tar.bzip2 is a compressed tar ball of all the
  files related to this homework.  Include the revised/ original
  source code files so that everything builds cleanly.  I expect to
  see subdirectories for each problem.  I expect to be able to build
  all three programs by invoking <tt>make</tt> at the top level.
