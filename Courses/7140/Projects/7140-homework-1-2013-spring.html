<h1>Home Work 1</h1>

<p>[This was for last semester.  For this semester, it will be
modified.  Real Soon Now.]

<p>Home work in this course is done individually, without help from
others.  The homework will be given piece meal and it is expected that
you will work on them as and when given without waiting for a due
date.  The eventual due date will be announced on the course home
page.

<ol>
<li> (30 points) A few attempted solutions to the following exercise
are given in the file
<a href="../Notes/mark-error-pos.cpp.html"> mark-error-pos.cpp</a>.
Study them and explain if any of them are correct.  When incorrect,
identify the "causes".  Do all this preferably without comipiling and
running it.  [Even though it is in C++, assume that the starting array
index is a 1 instead of a 0.]

<p>
We have one line of text, txt[].  Some syntax analysis marked certain
characters of txt[] to be in error.  The indices of these characters
are given as pos[].  You are to print txt[] line, and immediately
below it a line that has (i) an asterisk in position x iff x is in
pos[], or (ii) a blank otherwise.  Assume that txt[] is no longer than
100, and that pos[] is sorted in ascending order, i.e., pos[0] <
pos[1] < ... .


<li> (50 points) The file 
<a href="../Notes/worms.cpp.html"> worms.cpp</a> implements a
 primitive game example of wiggly worms moving about.  No
 documentation other than the embedded comments is available.  Revise
 it so that it is in "proper" OOP form.  Feel free to ignore its bugs,
 if any.  Write one or two paragraphs reporting on your experience
 with the tools you used to carry out this task.  [Added: Jan 26, 2013]
 Write entry- and exit-assertions for all the methods, and class
 invariants.  You may ignore, for now, assertions relating
 to <tt>ncurses.h</tt>.

<li>(20 points) Edwin Martin,  John Conway's Game of Life,
    <a href="http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/">
      http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/</a>.  Start with the Java
    source code provided and improve it in every possible way.  Make a
    list of your changes.  In particular, write entry- and
    exit-assertions for the methods, and class invariants of file
    named TBD and make sure that the code builds cleanly with the
    latest Java.

</ol>

<p>This Homework is now complete.  Turn in your answers as a tar ball
(or a zip).  On <tt>gandalf.cs.wright.edu</tt>
invoke <tt>~pmateti/cs7140/turnin Homework1 tarBallName.tar.bzip2</tt>
Include the revised/ original source code files so that everything
builds cleanly.  Other than the source code files, put everything else
together and produce one .pdf file.
