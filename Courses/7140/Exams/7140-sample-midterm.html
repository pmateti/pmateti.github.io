    <blockquote>
      <p>This exam permits the use of a Linux/Windows laptop/PC
	running g++, javac, ideaj and other software development
	tools.  It is otherwise a traditional closed book, closed
	notes exam.  You are expected to be aware of what constitutes
	cheating, and expected to be honor bound.  In particular, you
	are not permitted access to Internet (other than for Pilot
	submission) or any content already existing.  Your answers are
	expected to be in your own words after digesting the relevant
	educational materials.  Do not give or take help from others.
      <p>Submit your answers.pdf on Pilot.

    <ol>
      <li>(5 points each) The following statements may or may not be
	(fully or partially) valid.  Explain the underlined technical
	term</i> occurring in each statement.  Explain/ discuss/
	dispute the statement.  It is <i>possible</i> to write no more
	than, say, five, lines each, and yet receive full score.

	<ol type=i>
	  <li> If specs are given only in English, it is
	    hard to say whether the program is in error or
	  <u>requirements</u> are.
	  <li> If the <u>pre-condition</u> of a piece of code S
	    is <tt>true</tt>, you are asserting that S does terminate.
	  <li> The <u>Design by contract</u> principle requires the
	    use of assertions.
	  <li> There are <u>wicked problems</u> for which we cannot
	    write programs.
	  <li> A <u>functional specification</u> is a rigorous
	    description of the relationship between the inputs and
	    outputs.
      </ol></li>

      <li>(15 points each)

	<ol type="i">
	  <li> Consider an 
	    <a href="./QuickSort.java">
	      example implementation</a> of Quick Sort in Java.  Give
	    its weakest pre-condition and strongest post-conditions
	    and strongest loop invariant for the outermost loop of the
	    partition method.
	  <li> Develop clearly stated specs, in well chosen English,
	    Math, Logic, for Naur's Telegram problem reproduced here.
	    Resolve all ambiguities, "sins", etc. sympathetically, and
	    focus on specs. <i>
	      "Given a text consisting of words separated by BLANKS
	      or by NL (new line) characters, convert it to a
	      line-by-line form in accordance with the following
	      rules: (1) line breaks must be made only where the given
	      text has BLANK or NL; (2) each line is filled as far as
	      possible, as long as (3) no line will contain more than
	      MAXPOS characters."</i>

	  <li> Develop a design for the above in VHLL, a very high
	    level pseudo code language.  The pseudo code should be
	    good enough for a sophomore to code it in Java without any
	    interaction with you.
	  <li> Describe the Liskov Substitution Principle
	  rigorously. [Yet to cover this, Summer 2018]
	  <li> Explain each line of the JML assertions shown in group 5 of
	    <a href="./jml-one-page-ex-1.pdf">
	      jml-one-page-ex-1.pdf</a> [Ignore JML specifics.]
