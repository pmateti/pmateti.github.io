* Abstraction Dictionary Definition

1. ab·strac·tion abˈstrakSHən/ noun
1. the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.
   1. "topics will vary in degrees of abstraction"
   1. "the question can no longer be treated as an academic abstraction"
   1. synonyms: concept, idea, notion, thought, theory, hypothesis
      More
2. freedom from representational qualities in art.  "geometric
   abstraction has been a mainstay in her work"

* Data Abstractions
1. sets versus linear arrays, lists, hash table
2. bags versus ...
3. binary tree eg is not definable in Java
4. n-ary trees versus ...
5. Abstract Data Type (ADT)
   1. Algebraic Specs
   2. Classic Stack: push, pop, top, isempty, cons
   3. Modeling

* Control Abstractions

1. Multiple Assignment  x, y := a, b; x, y := y, x
2. for-all

** Control Abstractions: Map

3. map: apply a function f to all the values of a list
   1. list/ array/ vector L, L[ 0], L[ 1], ..., *sequence*
   2. f(L[ 0]), f(L[ 1]), ...
   3. map f L  (typical functional notation)

** Control Abstractions: Reduce

4. reduce
   1. Take a sequence, and insert a binary operation between consecutive
      items
   2. Insert plus: L[ 0] + L[ 1] + ...
   3. Is the bin op left- or right-associative?

* Abstraction v Encapsulation

1. Information Hiding
1. Abstraction is about ignoring nitty-gritty details while keeping
   essential details  (subjective judgement)
1. Encapsulation is about controlling access to methods that implement
   abstractions.

* OOP and Abstraction

1. Design by Contract (discussed in detail later)

1. Java and C++ pretty good at encapsulation; pretty poor on
   abstractions.

* Java and Abstraction

1. =abstract= key word has a "different" meaning
1. abstract class: incomplete, cannot be instantiated
1. abstract method: just a declaration, no body (implementation)
1. interface: =public static=, =final constant= or abstract method declarations
