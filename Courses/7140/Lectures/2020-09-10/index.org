* Announcements/ Reminders

1. We have one team of 3, two teams of 4. I will clarify in a few
   weeks the differences in work expectations.

1. Join Discord for discussions.  In addition to Pilot->Discussions.
   Learn what Discord is: https://discord.com/.  Here is the official
   invite to WSU CS Discord server: https://discord.gg/ks3pV7G.

1. Choice of the Project: DITAA it is! Read [Projects] linked on the
   Course Home Page.

* Previously

** Condense Ranges

   1. Examples illustrating the problem.
   1. Requirements Analysis (Essentials)
   2. Spec of Input (What is the syntax of input accepted?)
   3. Spec of Output (What is the syntax of output produced?)
   4. Relationship between Input Given and Output Produced
   5. Design is postponed (by a few weeks)


* Agenda

1. Project Related Action Items
1. Second lecture on Condense Ranges + Grammars + Math + Logic [Links
   on Course Home Page]

** Project Related

1. Action Item: Each of you (individually): (i) Start a journal. (ii)
   Download DITAA source code and build.  (iii) Engage in a team
   meeting using one of the team meeting tools mentioned in the
   lecture of 2020-09-01. (iv) Get a GitHub Team free account.  Due:
   Within the next 7 days.  Nothing to be turned in.
1. [[../Tools/IntelliJ-IDEA-HadiHariri.html][IntelliJ IDEA Minimal Survival Guide]] Highly recommended reading.
1. http://www.doxygen.org "Doxygen is the de facto standard tool for
   generating documentation from annotated C++, Java, Python
   ... sources."  Run it with the pathname of the directory containing
   the src code, and it generates a cross listed and nice looking
   browsable (HTML) listing of the src code files.

** Discrete Math + Logic

1. Sets, Bags, Tuples and Sequences
 1. Sets
 2. Bags
 3. Sequences
 4. Tuples
2. Tables
3. Functions and Relations
4. Propositions
5. Predicates
6. A implies B (A => B)
 1. Propositions A, B: A => B
 2. Predicates A, B: A => B
 3. For-All/ There-Exists P(x)
7. Weaker/Stronger Predicates


** Grammar

1. Grammars
 1. Chomsky Hierarchy
 2. Context Free Grammars (CFG)
2. BNF Notation
 1. Conventions
 2. Modern Notations
3. Grammars of Real PLs
 1. Best Practice
 2. Java
 3. C++/ C
4. Semantics of Languages
5. Derivation Trees
 1. Derivation Tree Example #1
 2. Derivation Tree Example #2
 3. Derivation Tree Example #3
6. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
 1. Example AST of an Arith Exp
 2. Example AST of an Arith Exp #2
 3. Example AST From JTransformer FOSS
 4. Example AST: Euclid's Algorithm for GCD

** Exercises

1. Exercise: Deduce the source code from the AST of Euclid's Algorithm
   for GCD.
1. Exercise: Does it "work"?
