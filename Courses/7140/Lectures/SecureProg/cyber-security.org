Abstract: In this course, we are discussing Cyber Security narrowed
down to software engineering.


* Improving Cyber Security

1. CPU Architecture
   1. Secure Boot
   1. Executable Address Space
1. Network Protocols
   1. Redesign of nearly all protocols
   1. Client/Server Dis-Trust
   1. Encrypted Packets
1. OS Design
   1. Privileges, Permissions, and Policies
   1. Process Lineage/ Provenance
   1. Address Space Layout Randomization
   1. Control-Flow Integrity
   1. Detection of Races
1. Cryptography
1. System Administration
1. Software Engineering
1. Only SE considered here, all others not

* Security Architecture Design Flaws

1. Cryptography misuse
1. Lack of compartmentalization
1. More privilege used than necessary
1. Relying on secret algorithms
1. Sharing resources 
1. Usability problems
