Large software systems are frequently composed of subsystems written
in different PLs.

* Graduate Students in Computer Science and Engineering

[These are (my) opinions.]

1. Must be fluent in Java, C++ and Python.  [Time constraints make us
   skip Python.]
1. Be familiar with Grammars, Abstract Syntax Trees, and *How* IDEs work.
1. Be familiar with ideas of Functional Programming and Logic Programming.
1. Be familiar with ideas of Domain Specific Languages.
