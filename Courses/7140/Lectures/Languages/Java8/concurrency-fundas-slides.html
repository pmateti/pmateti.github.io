<sectionX  id="text-1">
<p>
These are (refresher) notes on concurrency, discussed independently of
programming languages.  We are assuming that a course in OS concepts
has contributed pretty good understanding of concurrency, and
processes.  There are separate pages on how Java supports concurrency,
and even-driven programming.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Concurrency Fundamentals</h2>
<sectionX  id="text-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>What is concurrency?
</li>
<li>This section is independent of prog languages.
</li>
<li>This section is based on OS designs.

<h3 id="sec-2-1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Processes</h3>
<sectionX  id="text-2-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A process is a program in execution.  Process is dynamic; program
is static
</li>

<li>A process has its own virtual memory address space; by default,
unshared with other processes
</li>

<li>A process has a life cycle: born, ready-to-run,
waiting-for-an-event, running, suspended, &#x2026;, dead.
</li>

<li>IPC (Inter process communication) mechanisms help multiple
processes accomplish a joint computation.  Examples: send/recv
messages, shared memory, semaphores, signals/exceptions, pipes, &#x2026;
</li>
</ol>

<section id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Threads</h3>
<sectionX  id="text-2-2">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Current OS designs: Threads are always a part of a process.  A
single thread does not span multiple processes.  A simple process
may only have one thread.
</li>

<li>Current OS designs: Threads share the address space (and other
resuorces) of that process.
</li>

<li>Threads can be thought of as processes.  A thread is a more
abstract concept compared to process.  Conceptually, a thread is a
particular flow of control, mostly independent of other threads.
</li>

<li>Creating threads requires fewer resources than creating a process.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sec-2-3"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Scheduling</h3>
<sectionX  id="text-2-3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The OS controls when a process is in the running state &#x2013; i.e.,
assigned a CPU core.  Thread control is not entirely with the OS
control.  The parent process can exert influence.
</li>

<li>Scheduling Goal of OSs: All, not just a few, processes should make
progress in their computations.  Big assumption: The most critical
source is CPU (cores).  Any time the currently running process is
waiting for an event, switch to another process.
</li>

<li>Preemption: A running process P1 may be preempted so that another
process P2 may become running.  Even if P1 is not "willing" to
yield.  This is done by the OS from a perspective of managing all
the processes.
</li>

<section id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> Context switching</h3>
<sectionX  id="text-2-4">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Context: What does it take to save the state of a process before
preemption so that it can be resumed later (as if nothing
happened)?
</li>

<li>Context saving/restoring (i.e., switching) depends intricately on
CPU details, and OS design.
</li>

<li>In 2015, and modern CPUs: about 1000 - 3000 nano seconds for
process switch; about 500 nano seconds less for thread switch;
</li>

<h3 id="sec-2-5"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> Concepts behind IPC</h3>
<sectionX  id="text-2-5">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Message Passing: Process P1 has computed some thing, wishes to send
it to P2.  (Is P2 willing to receive? Is P2 ready to receieve).
</li>

<li>Synchronization: Process P1 must not go beyond a certain point a1
unless process P2 has (already) reached point a2.
</li>

<li>Mutual Exclusion: There is a section C1 of code within process P1.
There is a section C2 of code within process P2.  Required: C1 and
C2 should never be in execution simultaneously.  C1 and C2 may be
inside loops.  This generalizes to n processes.  Lots of intricate
details (re: why is this required, simultaneous, in-execution, &#x2026;)

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Dining Philosophers</h2>
<sectionX  id="text-3">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A classic problem, not solution, illustrating problems of
concurrency: Deadlocks, livelocks, starvation
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Assumption: Unlimited supply of food
</li>
<li>Assumption: Just one (!?) fork/chopstick between philosophers
</li>
<li>Assumption: Eating time is bounded
</li>
<li>Usually, number of phil = 5
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Solution requirements: no one should starve? can eat whenever one
gets hungry?
</li>

<li>Solution requires (i) the intro of a waiter (who is in control of
the forks/chopsticks), (ii) priority for some philosopher(s), or
(iii) covert channels.
