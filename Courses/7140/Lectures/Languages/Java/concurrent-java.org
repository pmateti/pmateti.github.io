* Abstract

These are notes on how Java supports concurrency.  There is a separate
page for Java support for event-driven programming.  We are assuming
that a course in OS concepts has contributed pretty good understanding
of concurrency, and processes.

* Concurrency Fundamentals

1. [[./concurrency-fundas.org]] Processes, Threads, msg passing, synch,
   mutex, scheduling, etc.  Language independent discussion.

1. the /happens-before/ relationship
1. Atomic Access
1. Locks

* Java Concurrency

1. Java had concurrency support from Java1. Java8 adds significant
   improvements.  [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/concurrency/changes8.html][Official docs]].

1. Defining and Starting a Thread
1. Synchronized Methods, Guarded Blocks
1. =java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService= Interface
1. Thread Pools
1. Fork/Join

** Example Source Code
1. [[../Java/src/Meenie.java]] Eeny, meeny, threads
1. http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaconcurrenta/ Open source. Java
   Concurrent Animated: Animations that show usage of concurrency
   features.
1. To try it out, download =javaConcurrentAnimated.jar=, and run\\
   =java -cp patName/javaConcurrentAnimated.jar vgrazi.concurrent.samples.launcher.ConcurrentExampleLauncher=

   above are all covered here.  Required Reading
