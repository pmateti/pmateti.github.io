* Abstract

JavaFX is the GUI building mechanism for Java applications.  It
replaces Swing.  Other alternatives are libGDX and Unity.  JavaFX GUI
uses threads, lambda expressions, etc.

* JavaFX Examples
** Trivial Example 1

1. [[./javaFxApp1.java]] Blank pane
1. =javac javaFxApp1.java; java javaFxApp1= is the simplest way to run this

** Not So Trivial Example 1

1. [[./javafxGrid.java]] Grid of Rectangles
1. Relevant to the grid of Game of Life

** Examples From the Web

   Not sure how good this is.


* JavaFX Overview

1. Graphics, UI, video, audio, etc.
2. Java APIs, integrated with Java 8; Not to be confused with JavaFX
   1.x, which is a scripting language, not a Java API
3. Effective JavaFX: Understand concurrency 
   1. [[../Concurrency/concurrency-fundas.org]]
   2. [[../Concurrency/concurrent-java.org]] 

4. Effective JavaFX: Understand event driven programming
   3. [[../EventDriven/]] Programming


** Replaces Swing

6. "Is JavaFX replacing Swing as the new client UI library for Java SE?"
1. "Yes. However, Swing will remain part of the Java SE specification
   for the foreseeable future, and therefore included in the
   JRE. While we recommend developers to leverage JavaFX APIs as much
   as possible when building new applications, it is possible to
   extend a Swing application with JavaFX, allowing for a smoother
   transition."  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/overview/faq-1446554.html#6

** JavaFX Getting Started

1. https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/get_started/jfxpub-get_started.htm
   Work with the source code as you read.  Highly Recommended Reading

1. Ensemble "provides a gallery of over 100 sample applications
   that use a wide range of JavaFX features, such as graphics, UI
   controls, animation, charts, media and WebView. Source code for
   each sample and links to API documentation are also
   provided. Ensemble will provide developers with an interactive
   reference tool for what they can build with JavaFX."

   tutorial, 2015. Presents JavaFX in the context of Android and iOS
   also.

* JavaFX App

1. Extend javafx.application.Application
1. Override the start() method
1. follow along [[./javafxGrid.java]] Grid of Rectangles

** Stage

1. Think of it as a window.  (Theater analogy)

** Scene

1. Container for a scene graph.
1. A stage can have multiple scenes.

** Pane
1. Organizer of nodes in scene graph
1. StackPane, FlowPane, TilePane, GridPane, etc

** Scene Graph

1. Tree of nodes; there is a root node.
1. A branch may have children (e.g., Group, Region)
1. Leaf does not have children, (e.g., Rectangle, Circle)

*  Events

** Std Control Flow
1. Branches (a conditional or switch selects control flow)
1. Loops (a loop repeats control flow)
1. Methods (a method call nests control flow)

** Even Based Control

1. The occurrence of event changes control flow
1. Event handling in UIs
1. Events are instances of =javafx.event.Event=

** Event properties:
1. Event type
1. Source
1. Target

** Event Driven Programming

1. [[../EventDriven][Language Independent Discussion]]

1. Java8 + JavaFX actions are typically written as Lambda Expressions.

2. [[../Java/JavaFX-EventDrivenProgramming-stonybrook.pdf][PDF]] Event-Driven Programming in JavaFX, slides, SUNY Stonybrook
   2015; includes src code of examples

   1. Explains Anonymous Classes
   2. Explains Inner Classes
   3. Explains Lambda Expressions


** Event handlers

1. An event handler will execute the code given when a certain event occurs.
1. Lambda expressions
1. For example: =scene.setOnKeyTyped(event -> { ... code ... })=

* JavaFX Games

1. Translation: Shifts a node from one position to another
1. Rotation:  Rotates a node around some point

** The Game Loop

1. Classically, a game will have at its heart a loop like this:
1. =while (notEndOfGame) { updateGameState(); renderGame(); }=

1. The frequency of the loop is referred to as the frame rate, and can
   determine the “smoothness” of the game play. 35mm film runs at
   24FPS. Video games often run at about 30-60FPS.

** A Game Loop in JavaFX

1. JavaFX takes care of rendering, and can update at about 60FPS when possible.

1. The AnimationTimer class can be used to get a call back every frame.

#+begin_src java
new AnimationTimer() {
   @Override
   public void handle(long now) { updateGameState(now); }
}.start();
#+end_src

* JavaFX Multithreaded
