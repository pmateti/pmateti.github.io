* Java GUI Frameworks

1. There are several to choose from.  Listed below a few.
1. We only need 2D
1. Size of the resulting program.
1. Here is an example QA:
   https://www.quora.com/With-which-should-I-start-developing-games-libGDX-framework-or-Unity3D

** Swing

1. Extract from
   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javafx/overview/faq-1446554.html#6

6. Is JavaFX replacing Swing as the new client UI library for Java SE?
1. Yes. However, Swing will remain part of the Java SE specification
   for the foreseeable future, and therefore included in the
   JRE. While we recommend developers to leverage JavaFX APIs as much
   as possible when building new applications, it is possible to
   extend a Swing application with JavaFX, allowing for a smoother
   transition.

** JavaFX

1. Ensemble "provides a gallery of over 100 sample applications
   that use a wide range of JavaFX features, such as graphics, UI
   controls, animation, charts, media and WebView. Source code for
   each sample and links to API documentation are also
   provided. Ensemble will provide developers with an interactive
   reference tool for what they can build with JavaFX."

** DukeScript

1. "Create cross-platform mobile and desktop applications with Java
   and HTML5.  Unlike other solutions which make use of Java on the
   server side, DukeScript uses Java on the client side without
   relying on Oracle’s plug-in used in the past to run applets."

1. "The technology runs on Android, iOS, desktop browsers, and any
   HTML5/JavaScript environment."

** LibGDX

1. Free and Open Source, Java
1. HTML and CSS
1. Ingress, Apparatus were developed on libGDX.
1. "Publish your games on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, BlackBerry
   and HTML5, all with the same code base."

** Unity

1. Game engine.
   1. Displaying, and animating objects
   2. Physics modeling: Collision detection 
   3. GUI
   4. Artificial Intelligence

2. Not open source, not free, but has a free version.
3. Monument Valley, Temple Run 2, Angry Birds Epic were developed on Unity.
4. http://unity3d.com/
