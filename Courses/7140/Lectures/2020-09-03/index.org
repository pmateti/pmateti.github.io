* Announcements/ Reminders

1. Action Item: Project Work. Form into teams of 3.  Due: Sep 07, 2020 11:59 PM
2. Action Item: Project Selection.  Due: Sep 07, 2020 11:59 PM
3. The above are Action Items for Me beyond this due date.
1. Learn what Discord is: https://discord.com/.  Here is the official
   WSU CS Discord server: https://discord.gg/ks3pV7G.

* Agenda

** Topics for Today

1. More on Assertions, Specs,  Design, VHLL
2. Discuss the above using Quick Sort.  
   1. You undoubtedly learnt Quick Sort years ago.  May be just one
      version.  Re-read whatever you used to learn it initially.
      Also, must read the ref given below.  This lecture refreshes
      Quicksort while raising a lot of questions.
   2. I am expecting you to figure out the answers and discuss among
      your selves on WSU CS Discord server [link given above].

** Exercises

1. Non-Functional Requirement: Assignments to array elements are
   disallowed.  Instead, you are given a primitive =exchange(i, j)=
   that exchanges =a[i]= with =a[j]=.

1. Design and implement a Quicksort program that honors the above.
   You are welcome to start with the Java program from the Princeton
   book.  [We are skipping requirements and specs.]

1. Specify =exchange(i, j)=.
1. Should we revise =exchange(i, j)= to =exchangea(a, i, j)=?  Context:
   Design of API.
1. Do an "intriguing" implementation of =exchange(i, j)=.  What do you
   mean "intriguing" ?!
1. You are required to enjoy (haha!) visiting https://www.ioccc.org/
   The International Obfuscated C Code Contest.  Every year!
