<h2>Catalog Description</h2> 

<p> [3 Credit Hours] This course covers advanced topics in software
engineering. Aspects of problem specification, design, verification,
and evaluation are discussed. We will focus on design methods,
including software patterns and software architecture, plus some
advanced topics involving formal methods of software specification or
evaluation using software metrics. Students will participate in team
projects to apply the methods discussed.  Prerequisites: CEG 4110 or
CEG 6110 Introduction to Software Engineering.
</p>

<h3>CEG 4110 - Intro to Software Engineering</h3>

<p>
Concepts of software engineering. Analysis, design, and implementation
of software engineering concepts that comprise structured programming
and design. Case studies serve as examples illustrating the software
life-cycle model.  Prerequisites: CS 3100

<h3>CS 3100 - Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>

<p>
Study of the implementation of data structures and control structures
in professional computer programs. Introduction to the fundamentals of
complexity and analysis. Study of common standard problems and
solutions (e.g., transitive closure and critical path). Emphasis on
high-level language software design.  Prerequisites: CS 1181 and MTH
2530 and MTH 2570

<h3>Comment on Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Ignore the CS/CEG prefixes.  Without the above two courses CEG 4110
or CEG 3110 (or their equivalent) you will find this course near
impossible.  It is also expected that you are (i) fluent in Java
and/or C++, and (ii) comfortable developing programs using Eclipse,
Netbeans, or
<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">
Intellij Idea.</a>

    Reading List for this course is a transitive closure starting from
    the course home page.  Items marked as Require Reading are sources
    for exam questions.  Other items do enhance your understanding,
    but, you may skip.

<h2>Course Content</h2>

<p>The following is tentative. The order of topics will be roughly as
indicated, except for project related discussions. The numbers in
parentheses at the end of each topic is an estimate of the number of
(75-minute) lectures I intend to devote.  I lecture on only the
conceptually difficult sections, leaving the rest as reading
assignments.</p>

<h2><b>Grading</b></h2>

<h3>Attendance</h3>

    <strike>Full attendance is expected.</strike>

    <p> Be aware of <a href="https://www.wright.edu/coronavirus">
        https://www.wright.edu/coronavirus</a> website content.
      Our lectures are asynchronous.
      
    Per week, you are expected to watch two lecture videos (75 min
    each) and study the associated lecture notes.  Visit the Course
    Home Page at least once a week.




<h3>Class and Newsgroup Participation 5%</h3>

<p>Please participate in the class room discussions. Feel free to
discuss openly, to ask what may appear to be dumb questions, and to
catch any errors that I make.  Be alert, study the backup material
right away, and solve the exercises promptly.</p>

<p>There is a local discussion group (see the link on the course home
page) that you should read and participate regularly as a vehicle for
discussing your solutions.  I will read this group regularly, and note
silently who is contributing what.  I expect other students to be able
to find flaws and fix them. Only when the most fundamental errors are
being made will I break my silence and contribute a response.</p>

<h3>Exams 20+25%</h3>

<p>There will be two exams contributing 20% plus 25% to the final
grade. The date for the mid-semester exam will be announced in
class. The date for the final exam is as set by the Registrar. Both
exams are closed-book, and comprehensive.  
</p>


<h3>Project 30%</h3>

<p>Project work in this course is done by small teams (of perhaps 3 or 4
students).  You will be given the source code files of a working
program written in either C++ or Java.  You will be asked to critique
it and make various improvements.  There are 6 tech reports
(Requirements, Specifications, Design, Implementation, Testing, and
Final Report), 5% each, due at various stages of the project.  The due
dates are on the course home page.  A description of the project will
be announced later. </p>

<h3>Homework 20%</h3>

<p>There are two homework assignments, each 10%.  These are to be done
individually.  The homework will be given piece meal and it is
expected that you will work on them as and when given without waiting
for a due date.  The eventual due date will be announced on the course
home page.

<p>
There is a penalty of 5% per day, Sat, Sun counted, for late
submissions.  Five days after the due date no submission is accepted.
