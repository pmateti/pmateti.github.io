<h1>Quick Terminology</h1>

<p>In a previous course, you undoubtedly learned what the following
  terms mean.  Here we briefly recapture and slightly narrow them for
  our immediate use in the context of our project's six technical
  reports.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>A Requirements Document describes the software project at its
  conception.  It is written from the users perspective.  In fact, it is
  good idea to actually write a first draft of a Users Manual and
  include it as an appendix.  It justifies why it is worthwhile to do
  it.  Unless the project topic is well known, such as editors,
  compilers, etc., it should expalin where it is coming from.

<p>In this course, we will almost always be starting from the source
  code of an already implemented project.  So, we pretend that it is
  yet to be constructed.

<p>In large projects, requirements elicitation is a major and
  difficult task.  Often requirements become clearer after a prototype
  has been built.

<p>We cannot really give a template as requirements depend on the
  given project.  Marsic's book has an example as an appendix.  Do a
  web search for examples.  There are some decent answers on
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"> http://stackoverflow.com/</a>.

<p>Related terms: Requirements Definition, Requirements Specification,
  Requirements Elicitation, Requirements Analysis.

<h2>Specifications</h2>
<h2>Design</h2>
