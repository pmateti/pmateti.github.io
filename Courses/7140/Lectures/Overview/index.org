* Course Goals

To enable you to

1. Develop, individually, a 1000+ lines program with great confidence.
   No bugs.  Well written Requirements, Specs, Design, Implementation,
   and Testing documents.
2. Practice with the best open source tools.
3. Be fluent in Java/Kotlin and C++, and become aware of newer
   programming languages.
3. Comprehend research literature.


* Prerequisites

1. CEG 4110 intro to Software Engineering and CS 3100 Data Structures
   and Algorithms.  Ignore the CS/CEG prefixes. Without the above two
   courses (or their equivalent) you will find this course near
   impossible.  More details at [[./7140-syllabus.html]]

1. It is also expected that you are (i) fluent in Java and/or C++, and
   (ii) comfortable developing programs using IntelliJ Idea, or
   Eclipse.

1. Be able to: Define/Describe {Requirements, Specifications, Design,
   Implementation and Testing}.

1. Typical deficiency: Grammars (BNF notation), Discrete Math, Logic.
   We will fill you in on these.

1. Quick survey: See below


* Accounts

1. The practical work of this course can be done on Linux or Windows.
   I recommend Linux.
2. CECS Account =thor.cs.wright.edu=
   1. This is a large Linux server. Intel Xeon 24 core CPU
      X5680, 132 GB RAM, etc.
   2. Unless you have a "named" account (not cs7140xy), your files
      will be wiped out soon after the finals.
   3. All work needs to be submitted using =~cs714000/turnin=

3. WSU Account =unixapps1.wright.edu=
   1. As a student of WSU, you have an account (named as in w123abc)
      on this Linux server.
   2. You can set up your own web site on this machine in the
      directory =~/www/=
   3. Read https://www.wright.edu/information-technology/

4. These two machines do not share userids or passwords.

3. [[http://piazza.com/wright/ *  /cs7140]]  Please enroll.
