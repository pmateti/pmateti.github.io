** Expectations of You

1. Typical prereq deficiency: Grammars, BNF, discrete math, and
   mathematical logic.  Refresher lectures for this will be spread
   over the semester.
1. Fluency in OOP languages, specifically C++, Java, and concepts.  No
   refresher.
1. I take cheating seriously. One case of cheating, and you will get
   an F in the entire course.
