* Accounts

1. The practical work of this course can be done on Linux or Windows.
   I recommend Linux.

2. CECS Account =thor.cs.wright.edu=
   1. As a grad student of CECS WSU, you can have a named account (as
      in first-initial-last-name) on this Linux server.
   3. Fill out a green form.
   1. This is a large Linux server. Intel Xeon 24 core CPU
      X5680, 132 GB RAM, etc.
   2. Unless you have a "named" account (not cs7140xy), your files
      will be wiped out soon after the finals.

3. WSU Account =unixapps1.wright.edu=
   1. As a student of WSU, you have an account (named as in w123abc)
      on this Linux server.
   2. You can set up your own web site on this machine in the
      directory =~/www/=
   3. Read https://www.wright.edu/information-technology/

4. These two machines (thor and unixapps1) do not share userids or
   passwords.
