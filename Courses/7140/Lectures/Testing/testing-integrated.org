Test (all) the units together.  It occurs after
unit testing and before validation testing.

It is fairly common that even after successful unit testing of all
units, integration testing fails.

* Approaches

1. The top-down approach: highest-level modules tested and integrated
   first.  Low-level utilities are tested relatively late in the
   development cycle.

1. The bottom-up approach starts at the lowest-level units be tested
   and integrated first. These units are frequently referred to as
   utility modules.

1. The third approach, sometimes referred to as the umbrella approach,
   requires testing along functional data and control-flow
   paths. 

* Misc

1. Sandwich Testing: Combine top down testing with bottom up testing.

1. Big Bang Testing: All component are integrated together at once,
   and then tested.
