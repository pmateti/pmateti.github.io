1. Oops Item: We lost the video of 2020-08-25 lecture. Sorry!  Lecture
   Notes are intact.
1. Action Item: Survey responses due: Aug 31, 2020.
1. You are expected to have taken CEG4111 Software Engineering here at
   WSU or an equivalent course elsewhere.  I will try to fill you in
   on most of the missing background/ prerequisites.  A survey for
   that purpose is posted on Pilot.  Here is a link
   https://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/7140/Lectures/Overview/survey.html
   Submit the written responses to the survey on Pilot.
1. Action Item: [[../../Projects/7140-project.html][Project Work]]. Form into teams of 3.  [We continue
   discussion on this in the next lecture.]
1. Action Item: [[../Overview/7140-syllabus.html][Syllabus]] Please read by next lecture.

* Agenda

** Metrics

1. =sloc= by David Wheeler
1. https://github.com/boyter/scc
1. The area of "Software Metrics".  Look it up!
1. SLOC of Linux, etc.

1. Size/Complexity: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code][wikipedia.org Source lines of code]] E.g., Windows
   has 40+ MLOC.  ansic: Linux: ansic 18991315 (97.91%), of which
   12977133 are drivers {ansic=12965717, perl=4459, asm=3842,
   yacc=1680, lex=771}

1. 5 - 50 bugs per KLOC?  Suppose 10% of the bugs result in security
   faults.  40,000 KLOC*5*10% = 25,000 security bugs.

** Programming in the Small .. Giga


  1. Can we define: program, software? Small, Medium, Large, ..., Giga?

  1. Our working/arbirary definitions:
      1.  Tiny: 00 -- 01 KLOC;
      1.  Small: 01  -- 10 KLOC;
      1.  Medium: 10 -- 01 MLOC;
      1.  Large: 01 -- 10 MLOC;
      1.  Giga: 10+ MLOC  

** Simple Problems

1. [[../Overview/simple-problems.html]]

** Wicked Problems

1. Exercise: Discover what these are.  In Software Engineering.
   Elsewhere.

1. Agree/Disagree: "There are wicked problems for which we cannot
   write programs."

** Software Qualities

1. [[../Overview/software-qualities.org]]

** Bit of Humor

1. [[../Overview/Humor/SwingCartoon/7140-life-cycle-cartoon.html][Software Life Cycle]]
1. [[../Overview/Humor/dilbert-1153.strip.sunday.gif][dilbert]]
1. [[../Overview/Humor/software-dev-5phases-humor.jpg][Software Dev Five Phases]]
