* Announcements/ Reminders

1. Action Item: Project Work. Form into teams of 3.  Due: Sep 07, 2020 11:59 PM
2. Action Item: Project Selection.  Due: Sep 07, 2020 11:59 PM
3. Action Item for me: Beyond this due date.

* Agenda

** Topics for Today

1. Assertions, Specs,  Design, VHLL, DNF, Tools [Links are on Course Home Page]
2. Introduce the above using DNF (Dutch National Flag Problem)

** Tools (For Now)

3. The following are arguably "the best" and I would
   like to see that you use them (at least for a few weeks).
   1. https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ IDE for Java, Kotlin, and Scala.
      Now part of Android Studio.  Free.
   2. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ IDE for (mainly) C and C++.
      Free.
   3. https://github.com/ Repository.  Free.  Produce a "cover page" ASAP.
   4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown From this *.md file you
      can generate *.pdf.  Use your choice of (free) tools.
   5. You must use your selection of "Collaboration Tools".  Examples:
      google-meet, slack, teams, trello, webex, zoom, etc.

1. This course expects you to develop skills in using several free
   (usually FOSS) tools beyond the above.  Exam questions on these do
   show up.


** Exercises

1. Exercises => No turn in. By all means, post your solution, and QAs
   to Pilot Discussion.
1. Exercise: Create a DNF program in both C++ and Java using the
   tools.  Use assertions as supported by C++ and Java.  Should
   include "pretty good" testing.  Found any bugs?
1. Exercises: Specify all the remaining problems mentioned in
   [[../Overview/simple-problems.org]] .  Skip design etc for now.  [Must
   be your own work.  Cut-n-paste of something you ran into is
   seriously frowned upon.]
