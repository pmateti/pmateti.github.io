* Assertions in C++ Programs

1. =#include <cassert>=        C++   =/usr/include/c++/7.*/cassert=
   (Version number may be newer.)
1. =#include <assert.h>=        C     =/usr/include/assert.h=

1. Defines the =assert()= macro.  Its argument must be a valid Boolean
   expression.

1. =#define NDEBUG=

   1. In the *absence* of this, the assert's boolexp gets compiled in.
      When executed, if it evaluates to "false", the macro-expanded
      compiled-in code witll print an error message including the line
      number of the source code, and aborts the process.

   1. In the presence of this (above the =#include=), the assert macro
      becomes empty, and there is no trace of the boolexp in the
      executable image.

1. Remember: 0 is false, and non-0 is true in C/C++

** Assertions in our [[http://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/7140/Notes/worms.cpp.html][C++ Worms]] Program

1. Are we to actually implement these assertions/invariants as proper
   C++ code or are you simply looking for assert()s?

   1. For example, did I want something like:
   #+BEGIN_SRC C++
#include <cassert>
#define MAXsegs 100
class Worm {
  ...
  private int nsegs;
  assert (nsegs <= MAXsegs)     // invariant
  ...
  public setNsegs(int segs) {
    assert(segs <= MAXsegs);
    nsegs = segs;
  }
}
   #+END_SRC

1. or something like this?
   #+BEGIN_SRC C++
#define MAXsegs 100
class Worm {
  ...
  private int nsegs; // nsegs <= MAXsegs
  ...
}
   #+END_SRC

1. Answer:  The first kind.

1. Focus on class invariants

   1.  E.g., what are the relationships on the x-, y- coordinates of
       the body segments of the worm?
   1.  How does direction affect this?
   1.  When a worm crawls, describe what happens to these values not
       as an algorithm but by relating previous values with current ones.
   1.  Etc.
