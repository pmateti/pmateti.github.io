<p>
In these notes, I used, in places, pseudo-code that is almost real PL.
Assertions are either enclosed in braces, following CS literature
tradition, not to be confused with blocks in C++ or Java, or given
using the notation /*@ ... assertion ... */.

<h2>Dutch National Flag Problem [Dijkstra]</h2>

<p>
Q: An array a[1..n] is filled with elements colored red, white or blue.
Rearrange the elements so that all the red-elements are at the left,
all the blues are at the right, and the whites are in the middle.  Do
not assume that red < white < blue.  We are expecting an O(n)
algorithm.  Focus on assertions.

<p>
A:

<pre>
r = w = 0;
b = n+1;
/*@ LI is a[1..r] is red and a[r+1 .. w] is white and a[b..n] is blue */
while  (w+1 < b) {
  switch (a[w+1]) {
    case white:
      w ++;
      break;
    case red:
      w ++;
      exchange a[w] with a[r+1];
      break;
    case blue:
      b --;
      exchange a[w+1] with a[b];
      break;
  }
}
/*@ w+1 == b and a[1..r] is red and a[r+1 .. w] is white and a[b..n] is blue */
</pre>

<p>The while loop terminates because the gap (b - w) guaranteedly
decreases in every iteration.

<p>You should also explain why/how the LI remains valid after each of
the switch-cases.

<h2>Game of Stanley Gill</h2>

<p>
Q. The following is known as the game of Stanley Gill (see Abacus,
Vol 4, No. 4, 1987, page 31).  State (1) the proof rule for
repeat-until, (2) a strong-enough loop invariant at the bottom of the
loop body, and (3) prove the correctness of the algorithm. 

<p>LCM stands for the 'least common multiple'; GCD stands for greatest
common divisor.

<pre>
{a > 0 and b > 0}
u := a; x := a;
v := b; y := b;
repeat
	if x < y then y := y - x; v := v + u fi;
	if y < x then x := x - y; u := u + v fi;
	{loop invariant}
until x = y
{x = y and ((x+y) div 2) = gcd(a, b) and ((u+v) div 2) = lcm(a, b)}
</pre>

<p>
A: (1) Proof rule for repeat-until:

<pre>
{P} S {Q}, Q and ~B -> P
------------------------------
{P} repeat S until B {Q and B}
</pre>

<p>
(2) A strong-enough loop invariant is given below.

<p>
a >= x > 0 and b >= y > 0 and u > 0 and v > 0
gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y)     and xv + yu = 2ab		(i)


<p>
(3) We show that (i) is a loop invariant.  Referring to the rule of repeat-
until above, both P, and Q are being taken as (i), and B as x != y.
It is trivial to see that Q and ~B -> Q.

<p> {(i)}  if x < y then y := y - x; v := v + u fi; {(i)}

and you can check that

<p> {(i)}  if y < x then x := x - y; u := u + v fi; {(i)}

<p>follows similarly.  If x >= y, the first of these assertions immediately
follows, so we need only worry about the case when x < y.  So, we need
to show

<p>{(i) and x < y} y := y - x; v := v + u fi; {(i)}.

<p>From the axiom of assignment, and the rule of consequence, this is
equivalent to showing that

<p>(i) and x < y implies
	a >= x > 0 and b >= y-x > 0 and u > 0 and v+u > 0
	gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y-x)     and x(v+u) + (y-x)u = 2ab

<p>This simplifies to

<p>(i) and x < y implies
	a >= x > 0 and b >= y-x > 0 and u > 0 and v+u > 0
	gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y-x)     and xv + yu = 2ab


<p>We know that gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, y-x) if x < y, so the above implication
follows easily.

<p>From the repeat-until rule, we can therefore conclude that Q and B,
which is

<p>a >= x > 0 and b >= y > 0 and u > 0 and v > 0
gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y)     and xv + yu = 2ab    and x = y

<p>holds at the end of the loop.  gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, x) = x = (x + y) div 2.
The harder part is to show that (u+v) div 2 = lcm(a, b).  This part of the
proof is independent of the above algorithm.  It only depends on the
number-theoretic properties of lcm and gcd, and here it goes:

<p>Let g = gcd(a, b).  Then a = gi, for some i, and b = gj, for some j,
such that i and j do not have any common factors. (Otherwise, g would
not be the gcd.)  Therefore, lcm(a, b) = lcm(gi, gj) = g*lcm(i, j) = gij.

<p>xv + yu = 2ab = 2gigj = 2ggij
	= g(v + u),			because x = y = gcd(a,b) = g

<p>Therefore, u + v = 2gij and lcm(a, b) = gij = (u+v) div 2.

<p>(Further exercise: Show that u+v is always even.)

<h2>GCD(a, b) where odd(a) or odd(b)</h2> Q. Give all three loop
invariants of the following algorithm, with the given pre- and
post-conditions.

<pre>
     1	{a > 0 & b > 0 & (odd(a) or odd(b)}
     2	x := a; y := b;
     3	loop
     4		while even(y) do y := y/2 od;
     5		while even(x) do x := x/2 od;
     6		if x = y then exit loop;
     7		if x < y then y := (y - x)/2 else
     8		if x > y then x := (x - y)/2
     9	end
    10	{x = y = gcd(a, b)}
</pre>

<p>A: LI == loop invariant.  The algorithm uses a loop construct with
a middle exit.</p>

LI0 between lines 5 and 6: gcd(x, y) = gcd(a, b).<br>
LI1 for the first while loop: gcd(x, y) = gcd(a, b).<br>
LI2 for the second while loop: gcd(x, y) = gcd(a, b).<br>

<p>(N.B. That all three have the same loop invariant is highly unusual.)


<p>
Exit assertion at 10 follows from LI0 because gcd(x, x) = x.


<p>  The proof
rules for the middle-exit loop are given below.
If the following three conditions hold</p>

	(1) {A} S1 {LI}<br>
	(2) {LI & not BX} S2; S1 {LI}<br>
	(3) LI & BX => B<br>
<p>
then we can conclude that the following holds.

<pre>
	{A}
	loop
		S1;
		{LI}
		if BX then exit loop;
		S2;
	end
	{B}
</pre>

<p>
Prove the correctness: See the Game of Stanley Gill for the rest.

<h2>Longest Ascending Subsequence</h2>
The function nlass(s) returns the length of longest ascending
subsequences of the string s.  Design an algorithm for it.  Convince
us, preferably through a correctness proof, that your algorithm
'works'.

<p>
The following solution is a mild adaptation of the solution and
discussion of the above problem from the book "The Science of Computer
Programming," Section 20.2 by David Gries.

<p>	Let s[1..n] be the given string, lass(x) stand for the set of
all longest ascending subsequences of x, and let len(x) stand for the
length of a longest ascending subsequence of x.  Suppose we have so
far examined s[1..i], and found k to be the length of longest asc
subseq, i.e.,

<p>P(d) is		k = len(s[1..i]) & 1 <= i <= n

<p>We would like to extend the above to hold for P(d+delta), where
delta is going to be the element s[i+1].  It is clear that, for i = 1,
k will be 1.

<p>Consider lass(s[1..i]).  

<hr size="1">
<h2>Previous Permutation</h2>


<p>Q: Systematically develop an algorithm for the `previous
permutation' problem. That is, given a sequence s of numbers, your
algorithm should generate a t, also a sequence of numbers, such that s
is the next permutation of t (as defined in class). Describe precisely
all intermediate steps in the development.

<p>
A:
The problem can be solved only if s is not sorted. 
Let n == length of s.
<p>
(a) Find i:1..n such that s[i] > s[i+1], and s[i+1..n] is sorted. 
<p>
(b)
Find j:i+1..n such that s[j] < s[i] and s[j] is the highest such
element. 
<p>(c) Exchange s[i] with s[j], and invert the tail s[i+1..n] 

<p>We leave the implementation details to you.

<hr size="1">
<h2>Print Error Marks</h2>

<p>
Q: In a printed line of length L, certain characters are marked.  The
marks are represented by a specific character (say, '*') printed below
each such character.  The positions (indices) of the marked characters
are given in an array p[1..n], n &gt;= 0.  These elements of p are
such that for all i: 1 &lt;= p[i] &lt;= L, and p[1] &lt;= p[2] &lt;=
p[3] &lt;= ...  &lt;= p[n].
</li></ol>
<pre>
        Example:  p = &lt;3, 6, 9, 19, 22&gt;, n = 5
        line of text :Thes broplem is peenuds.
        line of marks:  *  *  *         *  *
</pre>
<p>Investigate the following proposals (written in C) to print
the line of marks.  The line of text is assumed to have been
printed already.
</p>
<p>(i) Give the strongest loop invariant for each of
the loops in each `solution.'
</p>
<p>(ii) Which ones are correct?  Indicate the conditions under which
the incorrect ones fail.
</p>

<pre>
        #define n       whatever
        #define L       whatever

        int p[n+1];
        int i, j, k;

(a)     k = 1;
        for (i = 1; i &lt;= L; i++)
        {       if (i == p[k])
                {       putchar('*');
                        k ++;
                } else  putchar(' ');
        }

(b)     k = 1; p[n+1] = 0;
        for (i = 1; i &lt;= L; i++)
        {       if (i == p[k])
                {       putchar('*');
                        do { k++; } while (i == p[k]);
                } else  putchar(' ');
        }

(c)     i = 1;
        for (k = 1; k &lt;= n; k++)
        {       do {    putchar(' ');
                        i++;
                } while (i != p[k]);
                putchar('*');
                i++;
        }

(d)     i = 1; k = 1;
        do {
                while (i &lt;  p[k]) {putchar(' '); i++;}
                if    (i == p[k]) {putchar('*'); i++;}
                k++;
        } while (k &lt;= n);

(e)     i = 1; k = 1;
        while (k &lt;= n)
        {       while (i &lt;  p[k]) {putchar(' '); i++;}
                while (i == p[k]) k++;
                putchar('*');
        }
</pre>

Answer:

<p>The loop invariants of the various proposals are similar; so to save
space we use the following abbreviations.
</p>
<p>Let I stand for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= L+1.<br/>
Let K stand for 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n+1<br/>
Let P stand for (for all i:1..n-1(1 &lt;= p[i] &lt;= p[i+1] &lt;= L))<br/>
Let IKP stand for I &amp; K &amp; P.<br/>
Let s stand for the seq of chars printed so far; #s denotes the length of s.
</p>
<p>        Let a[1..y] denote the correct seq that needs to be printed;
i.e., for all j:1..y, a[j] == '*' iff p[k] == j for some k in 1..x;
a[j] == ' ', otherwise.  This seq a is clearly a function of p, x and y;
so we write a = es(p, x, y), es for expected seq.
</p>
<p>        Note that n may or may not be &lt;= L.  It is in establishing the
proper relationship between s and a that most of the proposals failed.
The relation should have been<br>
 s == a[1..i] == es(p, k, i) at all times, and<br>  s == a[1..L] == es(p, n, L) eventually.
</p>
<p>(a.i) IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, p[k-1]) | blank ^ (i - p[k-1]), where
blank ^ x stands for x-blanks when x &gt; 0, for empty seq when x &lt;= 0.
</p>
<p>(a.ii) The p[k]'s are not guaranteed to be distinct.  If they
are not, once an i equals p[k], k will get incremented and then
onwards it will remain unchanged.  Also, k can become equal to n+1.
</p>
<p>(b.i) IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i-1) for the for-loop.
</p><p>      IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i) for the do-loop at the boolean exp.
(b.ii) correct except for reference to p[n+1], which is non existent.
</p>
<p>(c.i) IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i-1) &amp; i-1 &lt;= p[k-1] for the for-loop, and
</p><p>      K&amp;P &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i) for the do-loop at the boolean exp.
Note that I is dropped from the second loop invariant.
(c.ii) Suppose p[1] == p[2] &gt;= 2. We then get an infinite sequence of
blanks after the '*'.  Also, if p[1] == 1, we get an inf seq of blanks.
</p>
<p>(d.i) IKP &amp; s == es(p, k, i) &amp; i-1 == p[k-1] at bool exp for the do-loop.
</p><p>      IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i-1) &amp; (k &lt;= n -&gt; i &lt;= p[k]) for the while-loop.
(d.ii) n can be 0, so that p[1] is undefined, and yet (d) accesses p[1].
The informal stmt of the problem does not quite say it, but don't we
want L chars (blanks/stars) printed?  (d) does not do that.
</p>
<p>(e.i) IKP &amp; s == esb(p, k-1) &amp; #s &lt;= i &lt;= p[k] for the outer while-loop.
IKP &amp; s == esb(p, k-1) | blank^x &amp; #s &lt;= i &lt;= p[k] for the inner
while-loops.<br/>
(e.ii) forgot to increment i after printing '*'; so fails, e.g., on p[1] = 1,
p[2] = 2.
