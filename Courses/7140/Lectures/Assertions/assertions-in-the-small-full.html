<h1>Notes on Programming With Assertions</h1>

<h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti">
    Prabhaker Mateti</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>These are notes on the usage of assertions in small programs.  I used
pseudo-code that is almost real PL.  Assertions are either enclosed in
braces (following CS literature tradition, not to be confused with
blocks in C++ or Java), or given using the notation /*@ ... assertion
... */.
</blockquote>

<h2>Mathematical Logic</h2>

Quick refresher from MTH 257.

<h3>Propositions</h3>

True and False are propositions.  For other
propositions, we often use letters.  These are assigned a True or
False value in an interpretation.  A formula involves these things and
the and (^) or (v) not (~) symbols also.  A well-formed-formula (wff)
is defined synatctically.

<h3>Predicates</h3>

<p>Ex: x > 1 is a predicate.  It has one free variable, x.  In the
programming context, think of free variables as globally scoped
variables.

<p>Predicates can onvole for-all and there-exists quantifiers.

<h2>Weaker/Stronger Predicates</h2>

<p>Simple example: x > 7 implies x > 1.


<p>P implies Q

<p>We say that P is stronger than Q.  Alt: Q is weaker than P.


<p>P and Q, in general, have free variables, x, y, z, ... Consider a
particular assignment A of values for each of x, y, z that make P come
out True.  A will also make Q True.

<p>In the context of programming, we can refer to this A as a "state".

<p>Let C(Q) be the collection of such assignment of values that make Q
come out as True.</br>  Let C(P) be the collection of such values that
make P come out as True.

<p>C(P) is a subset of C(Q)

<p>If C(P) = C(Q), P is equivalent to Q.



<h2>Floyd-Hoare Triples</h2>

{P} S {Q}<br>

<p>For all states s that satisfy P, executing S on s if and when S
terminates, the resulting state s' is such that s' staisfies Q.


<p>Note that the above is about partial correctness: It omits
termination.


<h2>Weakest Preconditions</h2>

<ol class=o>

<li>Let R stand for wp(S, Q).  R is an assertion/ predicate/ condition.
<p>For all states s that satisfy R, executing S on s guarantees that S
terminates, and the resulting state s' is such that s' staisfies Q.

<p>{wp(S, Q)} S {Q}<br>

<p>Note that wp() is about total correctness: It includes
termination.

<li><i>wp(S, False) = False</i> is impossible. True/False? Explain.

<p>
This is known as the Law of Excluded Miracle.  The phrase "is
impossible" apparently confuses some of you.  Understand it as "we
cannot do it" as in we cannot satisfy the precondition False and then
execute S.  So, for any Q, <i>wp(S, Q) = False</i> is impossible.


<li><i>wp(S, True ) = False</i> defines liveness of S.
	  True/False? Explain.
<p>
As stated above, it "is impossible".  But, what about
<i>wp(S, True ) = True</i>?  Dos this define liveness of S?


<li>Determine weakest
preconditions of the following. Show <i>all</i> intermediate steps. Assume
that all variables are of integer type.  PL code is shown enclosed in
braces.

<i><pre>
wp( {n := n + m; m := n + m; n := m - n},  (n == 6) and (m == 1) )</pre></i>


<pre class=sol>
= wp( {n := n + m; m := n + m}, (m - n == 6) and (m == 1) )
= wp( {n := n + m}, (n + m - n == 6) and (n + m == 1) )
= wp( {n := n + m}, (m == 6) and (n + m == 1) )
= (m == 6) and (n + m + m == 1)
= m == 6 and n == -11
</pre>

<i><pre>
wp( {if  i > j then i := i - j else j := i fi},  i == j )</pre></i>

<pre class=sol>
= (i > j => wp({i := i - j},i == j)) and (i <= j => wp({j := i}, i == j))
= (i > j => i - j == j) and (i <= j => i == i)
= (i > j => i == 2*j) and (i > j or true)
= (i <= j or i == 2*j) and (true)
= (i <= j or i == 2*j)
</pre>

<i><pre>
wp( {while i > 3 do i := i - 3 od},  i == 3 )</pre></i>

<pre class=sol>
P0 = (i <= 3) and (i == 3) = (i == 3)
P1 = (i > 3) and wp({i := i - 3}, i==3) = (i > 3) and (i-3 == 3) = (i == 6)
P2 = (i > 3) and wp({i := i - 3}, i==6) = (i > 3) and (i-3 == 6) = (i == 9)
Pk = i == 3*(k+1)

wp( {while i > 3 do i := i - 3 od},  i == 3 ) =  (P0 or &exist; k>= 0: Pk)
= (i == 3 or (&exist; k>= 0: i == 3*(k+1)))
= (&exist; k>= 1: i == 3*k)
= i == 3*k, for some k > 0
</pre>

</ol>



<h2>Bubble Sort</h2>

<pre class="brush: cpp">
template < typename T>
void BubbleSort(std::vector < T>& v) {
  const int size = v.size();
  for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < size - i; j++) {
      if (v[j] > v[j+1])
        std::swap(v[j], v[j+1]);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Write down the two loop invariants.

<h2>Dutch National Flag Problem [Dijkstra]</h2>

<p>
Q: An array a[1..n] is filled with elements colored red, white or blue.
Rearrange the elements so that all the red-elements are at the left,
all the blues are at the right, and the whites are in the middle.  Do
not assume that red < white < blue.  We are expecting an O(n)
algorithm.  Focus on assertions.

<p>
A:

<pre class="brush: cpp">
r = w = 0;
b = n+1;
/*@ LI is a[1..r] is red and
    a[r+1 .. w] is white and a[b..n] is blue */
while  (w+1 < b) {
  switch (a[w+1]) {
    case white:
      w ++;
      break;
    case red:
      w ++;
      exchange a[w] with a[r+1];
      break;
    case blue:
      b --;
      exchange a[w+1] with a[b];
      break;
  }
}
/*@ w+1 == b and a[1..r] is red and
    a[r+1 .. w] is white and a[b..n] is blue */
</pre>

<p>The while loop terminates because the gap (b - w) guaranteedly
decreases in every iteration.

<p>You should also explain why/how the LI remains valid after each of
the switch-cases.

<h2>Game of Stanley Gill</h2>

<p>
Q. The following is known as the game of Stanley Gill (see Abacus,
Vol 4, No. 4, 1987, page 31).  State (1) the proof rule for
repeat-until, (2) a strong-enough loop invariant at the bottom of the
loop body, and (3) prove the correctness of the algorithm. 

<p>LCM stands for the 'least common multiple'; GCD stands for greatest
common divisor.

<pre class="brush: cpp">
{a > 0 and b > 0}
u := a; x := a;
v := b; y := b;
repeat
 if x < y then y := y - x; v := v + u fi;
 if y < x then x := x - y; u := u + v fi;
 {loop invariant}
until x = y
{x = y and ((x+y) div 2) = gcd(a, b)
       and ((u+v) div 2) = lcm(a, b)}
</pre>

<p>
A: (1) Proof rule for repeat-until:

<pre>
{P} S {Q}, Q and ~B -> P
------------------------------
{P} repeat S until B {Q and B}
</pre>

<p>
(2) A strong-enough loop invariant is given below.

<p>
a >= x > 0 and b >= y > 0 and u > 0 and v > 0
gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y)     and xv + yu = 2ab		(i)


<p>
(3) We show that (i) is a loop invariant.  Referring to the rule of repeat-
until above, both P, and Q are being taken as (i), and B as x != y.
It is trivial to see that Q and ~B -> Q.

<p> {(i)}  if x < y then y := y - x; v := v + u fi; {(i)}

and you can check that

<p> {(i)}  if y < x then x := x - y; u := u + v fi; {(i)}

<p>follows similarly.  If x >= y, the first of these assertions immediately
follows, so we need only worry about the case when x < y.  So, we need
to show

<p>{(i) and x < y} y := y - x; v := v + u fi; {(i)}.

<p>From the axiom of assignment, and the rule of consequence, this is
equivalent to showing that

<p>(i) and x < y implies
	a >= x > 0 and b >= y-x > 0 and u > 0 and v+u > 0
	gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y-x)     and x(v+u) + (y-x)u = 2ab

<p>This simplifies to

<p>(i) and x < y implies
	a >= x > 0 and b >= y-x > 0 and u > 0 and v+u > 0
	gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y-x)     and xv + yu = 2ab


<p>We know that gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, y-x) if x < y, so the above implication
follows easily.

<p>From the repeat-until rule, we can therefore conclude that Q and B,
which is

<p>a >= x > 0 and b >= y > 0 and u > 0 and v > 0
gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, y)     and xv + yu = 2ab    and x = y

<p>holds at the end of the loop.  gcd(a, b) = gcd(x, x) = x = (x + y) div 2.
The harder part is to show that (u+v) div 2 = lcm(a, b).  This part of the
proof is independent of the above algorithm.  It only depends on the
number-theoretic properties of lcm and gcd, and here it goes:

<p>Let g = gcd(a, b).  Then a = gi, for some i, and b = gj, for some j,
such that i and j do not have any common factors. (Otherwise, g would
not be the gcd.)  Therefore, lcm(a, b) = lcm(gi, gj) = g*lcm(i, j) = gij.

<p>xv + yu = 2ab = 2gigj = 2ggij
	= g(v + u),			because x = y = gcd(a,b) = g

<p>Therefore, u + v = 2gij and lcm(a, b) = gij = (u+v) div 2.

<p>(Further exercise: Show that u+v is always even.)

<h2>GCD(a, b) where odd(a) or odd(b)</h2> Q. Give all three loop
invariants of the following algorithm, with the given pre- and
post-conditions.

<pre class="brush: cpp">
{a > 0 & b > 0 & (odd(a) or odd(b)}
x := a; y := b;
loop
  while even(y) do y := y/2 od;
  while even(x) do x := x/2 od;
  if x = y then exit loop;
  if x < y then y := (y - x)/2
  else
    if x > y then x := (x - y)/2
end
{x = y = gcd(a, b)}
</pre>

<p>A: LI == loop invariant.  The algorithm uses a loop construct with
a middle exit.</p>

LI0 between lines 5 and 6: gcd(x, y) = gcd(a, b).<br>
LI1 for the first while loop: gcd(x, y) = gcd(a, b).<br>
LI2 for the second while loop: gcd(x, y) = gcd(a, b).<br>

<p>(N.B. That all three have the same loop invariant is highly unusual.)


<p>
Exit assertion at 10 follows from LI0 because gcd(x, x) = x.


<p>  The proof
rules for the middle-exit loop are given below.
If the following three conditions hold</p>

	(1) {A} S1 {LI}<br>
	(2) {LI & not BX} S2; S1 {LI}<br>
	(3) LI & BX => B<br>
<p>
then we can conclude that the following holds.

<pre>
	{A}
	loop
		S1;
		{LI}
		if BX then exit loop;
		S2;
	end
	{B}
</pre>

<p>
Prove the correctness: See the Game of Stanley Gill for the rest.

<p>
Does {odd(a) or odd(b)} imply {a > 0 &amp; b > 0} ?

<h2>Longest Ascending Subsequence</h2>
The function nlass(s) returns the length of longest ascending
subsequences of the string s.  Design an algorithm for it.  Convince
us, preferably through a correctness proof, that your algorithm
'works'.

<p>
The following solution is a mild adaptation of the solution and
discussion of the above problem from the book "The Science of Computer
Programming," Section 20.2 by David Gries.

<p>	Let s[1..n] be the given string, lass(x) stand for the set of
all longest ascending subsequences of x, and let len(x) stand for the
length of a longest ascending subsequence of x.  Suppose we have so
far examined s[1..i], and found k to be the length of longest asc
subseq, i.e.,

<p>P(d) is		k = len(s[1..i]) & 1 <= i <= n

<p>We would like to extend the above to hold for P(d+delta), where
delta is going to be the element s[i+1].  It is clear that, for i = 1,
k will be 1.

<p>Consider lass(s[1..i]).  

<h2>Previous Permutation</h2>


<p>Q: Systematically develop an algorithm for the `previous
permutation' problem. That is, given a sequence s of numbers, your
algorithm should generate a t, also a sequence of numbers, such that s
is the next permutation of t (as defined in class). Describe precisely
all intermediate steps in the development.

<p>
A:
The problem can be solved only if s is not sorted. 
Let n == length of s.
<p>
(a) Find i:1..n such that s[i] > s[i+1], and s[i+1..n] is sorted. 
<p>
(b)
Find j:i+1..n such that s[j] < s[i] and s[j] is the highest such
element. 
<p>(c) Exchange s[i] with s[j], and invert the tail s[i+1..n] 

<p>We leave the implementation details to you.

<h2>Print Error Marks</h2>

<p>
Q: In a printed line of length L, certain characters are marked.  The
marks are represented by a specific character (say, '*') printed below
each such character.  The positions (indices) of the marked characters
are given in an array p[1..n], n &gt;= 0.  These elements of p are
such that for all i: 1 &lt;= p[i] &lt;= L, and p[1] &lt;= p[2] &lt;=
p[3] &lt;= ...  &lt;= p[n].
</li></ol>
<pre>
        Example:  p = &lt;3, 6, 9, 19, 22&gt;, n = 5
        line of text :Thes broplem is peenuds.
        line of marks:  *  *  *         *  *
</pre>
<p>Investigate the following proposals (written in C) to print
the line of marks.  The line of text is assumed to have been
printed already.
</p>
<p>(i) Give the strongest loop invariant for each of
the loops in each `solution.'
</p>
<p>(ii) Which ones are correct?  Indicate the conditions under which
the incorrect ones fail.
</p>

<pre>
  #define n       whatever
  #define L       whatever

  int p[n+1];
  int i, j, k;

(a)     k = 1;
  for (i = 1; i &lt;= L; i++)
  {       if (i == p[k])
  {       putchar('*');
  k ++;
  } else  putchar(' ');
  }

(b)     k = 1; p[n+1] = 0;
        for (i = 1; i &lt;= L; i++)
        {       if (i == p[k])
                {       putchar('*');
                        do { k++; } while (i == p[k]);
                } else  putchar(' ');
        }

(c)     i = 1;
        for (k = 1; k &lt;= n; k++)
        {       do {    putchar(' ');
                        i++;
                } while (i != p[k]);
                putchar('*');
                i++;
        }

(d)     i = 1; k = 1;
        do {
                while (i &lt;  p[k]) {putchar(' '); i++;}
                if    (i == p[k]) {putchar('*'); i++;}
                k++;
        } while (k &lt;= n);

(e)     i = 1; k = 1;
        while (k &lt;= n)
        {       while (i &lt;  p[k]) {putchar(' '); i++;}
                while (i == p[k]) k++;
                putchar('*');
        }
</pre>

Answer:

<p>The loop invariants of the various proposals are similar; so to save
space we use the following abbreviations.
</p>
<p>Let I stand for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= L+1.<br/>
Let K stand for 1 &lt;= k &lt;= n+1<br/>
Let P stand for (for all i:1..n-1(1 &lt;= p[i] &lt;= p[i+1] &lt;= L))<br/>
Let IKP stand for I &amp; K &amp; P.<br/>
Let s stand for the seq of chars printed so far; #s denotes the length of s.
</p>
<p>        Let a[1..y] denote the correct seq that needs to be printed;
i.e., for all j:1..y, a[j] == '*' iff p[k] == j for some k in 1..x;
a[j] == ' ', otherwise.  This seq a is clearly a function of p, x and y;
so we write a = es(p, x, y), es for expected seq.
</p>
<p>        Note that n may or may not be &lt;= L.  It is in establishing the
proper relationship between s and a that most of the proposals failed.
The relation should have been<br>
 s == a[1..i] == es(p, k, i) at all times, and<br>  s == a[1..L] == es(p, n, L) eventually.
</p>
<p>(a.i) IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, p[k-1]) | blank ^ (i - p[k-1]), where
blank ^ x stands for x-blanks when x &gt; 0, for empty seq when x &lt;= 0.
</p>
<p>(a.ii) The p[k]'s are not guaranteed to be distinct.  If they
are not, once an i equals p[k], k will get incremented and then
onwards it will remain unchanged.  Also, k can become equal to n+1.
</p>
<p>(b.i) IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i-1) for the for-loop.
</p><p>      IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i) for the do-loop at the boolean exp.
(b.ii) correct except for reference to p[n+1], which is non existent.
</p>
<p>(c.i) IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i-1) &amp; i-1 &lt;= p[k-1] for the for-loop, and
</p><p>      K&amp;P &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i) for the do-loop at the boolean exp.
Note that I is dropped from the second loop invariant.
(c.ii) Suppose p[1] == p[2] &gt;= 2. We then get an infinite sequence of
blanks after the '*'.  Also, if p[1] == 1, we get an inf seq of blanks.
</p>
<p>(d.i) IKP &amp; s == es(p, k, i) &amp; i-1 == p[k-1] at bool exp for the do-loop.
</p><p>      IKP &amp; s == es(p, k-1, i-1) &amp; (k &lt;= n -&gt; i &lt;= p[k]) for the while-loop.
(d.ii) n can be 0, so that p[1] is undefined, and yet (d) accesses p[1].
The informal stmt of the problem does not quite say it, but don't we
want L chars (blanks/stars) printed?  (d) does not do that.
</p>
<p>(e.i) IKP &amp; s == esb(p, k-1) &amp; #s &lt;= i &lt;= p[k] for the outer while-loop.
IKP &amp; s == esb(p, k-1) | blank^x &amp; #s &lt;= i &lt;= p[k] for the inner
while-loops.<br/>
(e.ii) forgot to increment i after printing '*'; so fails, e.g., on p[1] = 1,
p[2] = 2.
</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ol>

<li>[01/10] Almost all introductory programming books have code for
sorting and searching.  It is likely that these are without
assertions.  Provide assertions and verify that the code is correct.
Focus on: Sorting {bubble sort, quicksort, merge sort}; Searching
{linear search, binary search}.

<li>[02/10] Introduce a primitive: exchange(i, j) whose pseudo-code is
shown below:
<pre>
typedef ordered but opaque is item;
typedef 0 .. n-1 is index;
global array a[index] of item;

exchange(index i, index j)
{
  item temp := a[i];
  a[i] := a[j];
  a[j] := temp
}
</pre>
Specify exchange().  Rewrite the code of quick sort using this
primitive and with the additional constraint of using no variables of
type item other than the a[].  Verify the correctness of this revised
version of quick sort.

<li>[10++] Proving correctness is almost always hard.  Proving
termination is almost always easy.  In rare cases it can be very
difficult.

<pre class="brush: cpp">
/*@ x is the given input integer, x &gt; 0 */
while (x > 1) {
    if (x % 2 == 0)
        x /= 2;
    else
        x = 3*x + 1;
}
</pre>

Does this terminate for arbitrary integers x > 0?  Ignore arithmetic
overflow issues.  Read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Collatz_conjecture</a>.  </li>

  <li> Does the precondition and statement {x&nbsp; &ge; 4 } &lt; x := x - 4 
    &gt; interfere with the triple<br>
    {x is odd} &lt; x := x + 5 &gt; {x is even}.</li>
  <li> Using the technique of weakened assertions, prove that {x = 1}
    S {x = 7} is a theorem, where S is <tt> &nbsp;co &lt; x := x+1&gt;
    || &lt; x := x+2&gt; || &lt; x := x+3&gt; oc</tt></li>
