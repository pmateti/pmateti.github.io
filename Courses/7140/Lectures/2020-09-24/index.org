** Literate Programming

1. Write Programs as if explaining it to fellow programmers.
1. http://www.literateprogramming.com/
1. Knuth's Tools: =.web= files, =weave= generates =.tex=, =tangle= extracts
   src code;
1. https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/ "Noweb â€” A Simple, Extensible
   Tool for Literate Programming" On Debian/ Ubuntu: =sudo apt install
   noweb= Multiple PLs.  Multiple files.  Highly recommended.
1. Donald E. Knuth, "A Solution to the Common Words Problem",
   Communications of the ACM, 1986. Knuth is a Turing Award

   paper, but search for another PDF link for a clean
   version). Required Reading.  1. As an example of Literate
   Programming.  This is an example of a =.pdf= generated from a
   =.web= file.

** Common Words Problem

1. As an example of Req Analysis, Specs, and Design Hierarchy.
