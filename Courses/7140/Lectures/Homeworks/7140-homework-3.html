<h1>(Bonus Points) Home Work 3</h1>

<p>[This was for last semester.  For this semester, it will be
modified.  Real Soon Now.]

<p>Home work in this course is done individually, without help from
others.  <strike>The homework will be given piece meal and it is
expected that you will work on them as and when given without waiting
for a due date.</strike>  The due date is announced on the course home
page.

<p>This homework is optional.  Points earned on this homework are
considered "bonus points."  I explained in the lectures how I intend
to use these points.  Here is a summary of that explanation.  I
determine the grading "curves" without using the bonus points.  I then
add the 10% weighted bonus points to your total score.  This may bring
you up (at most) by one letter-grade (e.g., from a B to an A).


<ol>

<li> (20 points) [Literate Programming] Find a 5+ page long Java
  program of your own (or an open source program discovered on the
  web) that exemplifies the OOP design by contract principles. Express
  it as a literate program (LP).  You may use any of the LP tools
  mentioned in Home Work 2.

<li> (20 points) [JML] Thoroughly document the Java program selected
  for the problem above using JML assertions (i.e., invariant,
  requires, ensures, assignable, ...).

<li> (20 points) [JUnit and TestNG] Take the QuickSort.java code used
  in the Midterm as the test target.  Use both JUnit and TestNG.
  Include a paragraph or two comparing your experineces in using both.

<li> (20 points) [JUnit or TestNG] Reconsider the "mark error
  positions" code of Home Work 1.  First, fix the array index error
  that crept in as I translated Wirth's Pascal code into C++.  That
  is, array index variables i and k now start at 0, as they should in
  C++.  Use JUnit or TestNG framework to determine which of the
  methods markErrorPosA to markErrorPosE are "correct".  For all the
  incorrect ones, exhibit two or more example imputs on which they do
  work properly.

<li> (20 points) Install the Eclipse plugin from 
  <a href="http://www.crap4j.org/">
  http://www.crap4j.org/</a>.  "Crap4j is a Java implementation of the
  CRAP (Change Risk Analysis and Predictions) software metric -- a
  mildly offensive metric name to help protect you from truly
  offensive code."  Run it on the jEdit + Your-Plugin files.  Include
  the generated report and your commentary.

<li> (00 points) Please maintain a journal for this homework.  Submit
  a summary.
</ol>

<p>This Homework3 is complete.

<p>Turn in your answers as a tar ball (or a zip).
  On <tt>gandalf.cs.wright.edu</tt> invoke <tt>~pmateti/cs7140/turnin
  Homework3 tarBallName</tt> Include the source code files so that
  everything builds cleanly.  Other than the source code files,
  put <b>everything else</b>, including diagrams, screen shots, ...,
  together and produce one .pdf file.
