* Remote Teaching

1. [[../Overview/welcome.org][Welcome]] to CS 7140 Advanced Software Engineering

1. In the context of https://www.wright.edu/coronavirus our lectures
   are asynchronous. Per week, you are expected to watch two lecture
   videos (75 min each) and study the associated lecture notes.  I
   will be posting the lectures on Tue and Thurs.  Around noon.

1. Visit the Course Home Page
   https://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/7140 at least once a
   week.  This has links to syllabus, old exams, lecture videos +
   notes and labs.

4. [[../../Top/index.html][Weekly Schedule and Due Dates]]

1. Click on "Lectures" gives you dir listing: Dated Dirs; Topic Dirs

1. The Dated Dir (e.g., 2020-08-25/) gives/links the lecture video as
   well as lecture notes.  The videos are stored within Pilot Panopto.

1. "Office Hours" are through questions/answers posted on Pilot
   Discussion for academic matters, and through emails if they are
   personal.  As needed, we can do video chats.


* Agenda

** Action Items

1. Watch these videos on Pilot -> Panopto:
   1. [[https://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=de9f1b15-7643-4451-9111-ac2200f62cd5][Freshly video taped lecture]] . About 25 min.  Covers this page of
      notes.
   1. A [[https://wrightstate.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=eb009636-c96e-4d7f-a1d5-a948011859d9&query=ASE%208%2027%202018#][video of a lecture of mine from the past]] Covers project and
      team related issues.  About 30 min.

1. [[../Overview/accounts.org][Accounts]] on Computing Systems

1. You are expected to have taken CEG4111 Software Engineering here at
   WSU or an equivalent course elsewhere.  I will try to fill you in
   on most of the missing background/ prerequisites.  A survey for
   that purpose is posted on Pilot.  Here is a link
   https://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/7140/Lectures/Overview/survey.html
   Submit the written responses to the survey on Pilot. Due: Aug
   31, 2020.

5. Form into Teams of 3.  Read [[../../Projects/7140-project.html][Projects]].  Due date: ASAP. EOF next week?

** Expectations of You

1. Typical prereq deficiency: Grammars, BNF, discrete math, and
   mathematical logic.  Refresher lectures for this will be spread
   over the semester.
1. Fluency in OOP languages, specifically C++, Java, and concepts.  No
   refresher.
1. I take cheating seriously. One case of cheating, and you will get
   an F in the entire course.

** Course Content

1. [[../Overview/7140-syllabus.html][Syllabus]] Please read.

1. Course [[../Overview/index.org][Overview]]. Several short example programs.  Rigorously
   understood.  Two home works that require lengthy study. One team
   project focused on maintenance of an existing FOSS.

1. [[../../Projects/7140-project.html][Project Work]]. Form into teams of 3. The second video covers this.
   We continue in the next lecture.

1. There are two home works. Done individually.  Not team work.  Visit
   https://cecs.wright.edu/~pmateti/Courses/7140.
