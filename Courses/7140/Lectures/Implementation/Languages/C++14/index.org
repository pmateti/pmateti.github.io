1. What is a standard?
   1. https://isocpp.org/std
   2. http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/

1. TS: "A normative document representing the technical consensus
   within an ISO committee".  TS is a preview of a standard.  ISO
   requires that every TS either becomes standard or is withdrawn in 6
   years.

1. TR: "An informative document containing information of a different
   kind from that normally published in a normative document."

* C++1x Features

1. Generic lambdas: =auto lambda = [](auto x, auto y) {return x + y;};=
1. Constant Expressions: A =constexpr= is computed at compile time.
1. Type Deduction of Return Value: =auto DeducedReturnTypeFunction();=

1. https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx14 g++ support

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization][RAII]] (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) "In RAII, holding a
   resource is a class invariant, and is tied to object lifetime".
   Resource acquisition is done by the constructor.  Resource release
   is done by the destructor.  Scope Bound Resource Management (SBRM)
   is a better name for RAII?

1. C++1x move semantics

** Pointers

1. =new= and =delete= are (almost) unnecessary.

1. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allocator_(C%2B%2B)][Allocator]] The standard library provides several containers. They
   grow/ shrink.

1. Different types of smart pointers: =shared_ptr<T>=, =unique_ptr=,
   =scoped_ptr=, =make_shared=, =make_unique=

* Exercise

1.  As a learning experience, fix this [[../Examples/worms-2013-08-00][worms example code]] so that it
    is C++14 compliant.
