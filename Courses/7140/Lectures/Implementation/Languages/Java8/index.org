* Scala

1. Scala is a "modern version" of Java.
   1. Elimination of "boiler plate" code: setters, getters,
      constructors auto generated.
   2. FOSS Project https://projectlombok.org/ does that for Java, by
      manipulating the ASTs.
   3. Syntax is substantially different.
   4. Most of Java 8 and Java 9 features are already in Scala.
   5. Design of Scala started in 2001.
2. Type inference is an integral part of Scala.
3. Has functional programming features also.
