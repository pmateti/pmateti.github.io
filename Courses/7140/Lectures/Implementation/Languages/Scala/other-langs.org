   Nerval's Lobster writes: Perhaps the most famous rant against C++
   came from none other than Linus Torvalds in 2007. "C++ is a
   horrible language," he wrote, for starters. "It's made more
   horrible by the fact that a lot of substandard programmers use it,
   to the point where it's much much easier to generate total and
   utter crap with it." He's not alone: A lot of developers dislike
   how much C++ can do "behind the scenes" with STL and Boost, leading
   to potential instability and inefficiency. And yet there's still
   demand for C++ out there. Over at Dice, Jeff Cogswell argues that
   C++ doesn't deserve the hatred. "I've witnessed a lot of
   'over-engineering' in my life, wherein people would write reusable
   classes with several layers of inheritance, even though the
   reusable class wasn't actually used more than once," he wrote. "But
   I would argue that's the exception, not the norm; when done right,
   generic programming and other high-level aspects of C++ can provide
   enormous benefits." Was Linus going overboard?
