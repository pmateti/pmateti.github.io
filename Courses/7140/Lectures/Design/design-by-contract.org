* Background

1. [[../Assertions/][Assertions]]
1. Correct by Design

* Contract?

1. Imagine: You are subcontracting out the design and construction of
   subsystems (classes) or methods.
1. Assigning blame across interfaces
1. Details of method responsibilities

** An Example Contract

1. A contract can be satisfied in many ways
  1. a method can have many implementation satisfying the contract;
  1. Different performances (time, space, etc);
1. A contract hides the implementation details
  1. We can change implementations.
  1. Caller's code Will work for any implementation that satisfies the
   contract

* Techniques

** Public Methods

1. Weakest Pre-conditions  =requires= for public methods
   1. The called method assumes precondition holds
   1. Avoiding constantly checking arguments
   1. The caller guarantees precondition holds

1. Strongest Post-conditions =ensures= for public methods
   1. The called method guarantees postcondition
   1. The caller method is guaranteed  postcondition

** Class Invariants  

1. Consider only the public methods Their entry- exit-
   assertions. Rewrite, if nec, using and's (at the top level)
1. The common portion across all the above is the /class invariant/
1. Strongest Class invariant
