"A design rationale is the explicit listing of decisions made during a
design process, and the reasons why those decisions were made. Its
primary goal is to support designers by providing a means to record
and communicate the argumentation and reasoning behind the design
process.  It should therefore include:

+ the reasons behind a design decision,
+ the justification for it,
+ the other alternatives considered,
+ the trade offs evaluated, and
+ the argumentation that led to the decision."
+ [from Wikipedia]
