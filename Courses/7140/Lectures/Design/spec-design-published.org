* JavaCard
1. JavaCard is a subset of Java chosen for small memory, weak-CPU, embedded
   devices.  Widely used in SIM cards and ATM cards.

* Knuth's Common Words Problem
1. "Given a file of text, and a number k, print the k most common words."
1. Used as an example of Literate Programming
1. Criticized as an example of software development
1. Our interest here:  How to describe its spec + design?
1. Defs of text, words, ...
1. Def of "common" word
1. n-ary Tries, ...
1. Destructive Traversals
