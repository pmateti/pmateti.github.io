* Abstract

This is the landing page for Specs.  There are several examples.  Some
large examples are just outlines.  Each of these spec examples are
consdidered later under [[../Design][Design]].  Student is assumed to be familiar
with the waterfall model.

* Intro

   1. Different Axes of Specs
      1. Functional Specs
      2. Performance/ Resources Specs
      3. Maintainability
      4. A list of different specs by Hoare
   2. Seven Sins of a Specifier
      1. Silence
      2. Noise
      3. Overspec
      4. Contradiction
      5. Ambiguity
      6. Forward Reference
      7. Wishful Thinking
      8. Shall we order these based on ...?
      1. Meyer, Bertrand, [[http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/ieee/formalism.pdf]["On Formalism In Specifications"]], IEEE
         Software, 1985, vol. 2, no. 1. pp. 6-26.  (Meyer is the
         designer of the excellent OOPL named Eiffel.)  Required
         Reading.

   3. Correct by Design, Correct wrt Assertions
   4. Specs v Final Programs
   1. [[./specs-101.org][Software Specs 101]] all the above


* Well Known Example Specs

  1. Functional Specs
  1. [[./spec-examples-small.org][Specifications of Tiny Example Programs]]
  4. [[../Examples/Knuth-CWP/][Spec of Knuth's Common Words Problem]]
  7. [[./stack-adt.org][Algebraic Specs: Stack ADT]]

* Larger Specs

1. Why can't we specify large programs?  What does it take?
   1. Background in Discrete Math
   2. Background in Mathematical Logic
   3. Background in Functional Programming
   4. Extensive Experience in Software Development + Maintenance
2. [[./wicked-problems.org][Wicked Problems]]
3. [[./spec-examples-large.org][Specifications of SLOC 10000+ Example Programs]]
