    <h1>Project Work</h1>


    <p>[This was for last semester.  For this semester, it will be
      modified.  Real Soon Now.]</p>

    <a href="../Notes/terminology.html"> Terminology</a> |
    <a href="./7140-project-teams.html"> List of Teams</a>

    <p>Project work in this course is done by small teams.  You will be
      given the source code files of a working program written in either C++
      or Java.  You will be asked to critique it and make various
      improvements.  There are 6 tech reports (Requirements, Specifications,
      Design, Implementation, Testing, and Final Report), 5% each, due at
      various stages of the project.  The due dates are on the course home
      page.
    </p>

    <p>This semester form into teams of at most 3 people.  I will be
      willing to adjust the "quantity" of work if you happen to form into
      teams of just two.</p>

    <p>This semester we are using jEdit as a starting point of a software
      project for this course.  It is complex enough that we could not
      have done it if we started afresh to design and build it.  We hope
      to contribute to the jEdit project at-large the various missing
      pieces that a class room software engineering expects to be there --
      e.g. the various documents. </p>

    <p>jEdit is written in Java.  Download the open source code, latest
      version, build it and use it well enough to understand its
      capabilities.  </p>

    <p>
      You will be expected to use tools such as Eclipse, Intellij Idea, git,
      make, ant, JML, and others introduced in the next few
      weeks.
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <p> There was no Requirements Document written for jEdit&nbsp; by its
      authors.  Pretending that jEdit implementation does not exist yet,
      write this document addressing existing features and the items
      listed below.  It is expected that different teams will propose to
      different things.  But all of you must address the following in your
      Requirements Document.  Some of these are subjective -- make them as
      objective as possible.</p>

    <ol>
      <li> Limit yourself to jEdit's code dealing with plain text,
	C++, Java editing, and plugin support.
      <li>Improve its look-and-feel to match Eclipse.  
      <li>Develop a new and useful plugin.  See
	<a href="http://www.jedit.org/?page=devel">
	  http://www.jedit.org/?page=devel</a>
      <li>Discover and fix at least one bug (not found by any one else)
	per team member (or throw in your claim that jEdit is bug-free).
      <li> Improve the maintainability of jEdit.  Describe, as of now, as
	many of these improvements as possible.  During the semester, we
	will discuss several subtopics of maintenance.
      <li>Improved jEdit code size should be 5% smaller (as measured
	through the .class files) than what it is now. Please look up on how
	to measure byte code size from class files ignoring all meta
	data.&nbsp; The reduction in size is excluding the code of Your
	Plugin.</ol>

    <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <p>There was no Specifications Document written for jEdit&nbsp; by
      its authors, apart from an API description to help the writers of
      jEdit Plugins.  Pretending that jEdit implementation does not
      exist yet, write this document addressing existing features and
      the items listed above.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>[The following is added on Mar 25, 2013]</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There was no Design Document written for jEdit 
	by its authors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Study the jEdit implementation as-is and 
	write this document addressing existing features and the items listed 
	above. We are extracting &quot;the&quot; design of jEdit from its existing 
	implementation in Java -- in the absence of Req, Spec, and Design 
	documents by jEdit's authors. </li>
      <li>Maintain a journal. In the next submission, I will ask it to
	be included. </li>

      <li>Most of you understood the design of the core of jEdit well
	enough. But you need to articulate it in the submitted
	doc. </li>

      <li>(Say 20 points?) Having used jEdit for a week or so, a
	fellow developer is now interested in understanding how it is
	designed. (S)he already finished reading your Req and Specs,
	and is now reading your Design Doc. Assume that (s)he also
	knows about how editors are typically designed: buffers,
	cursors, etc. How well does reading your document help? </li>

      <li>(20?) Every modern text editor has buffers, cursors,
	view-windows, cut-paste-containers, kbd + mouse input methods,
	undo/redo, ... Did this doc describe their design, as done in
	jEdit? </li>

      <li>(20?) The design of Your Plugin? This is 
	new and yours. So more detail and precision is expected. Carefully 
	chosen pseudo code, diagrams, etc. are expected.
	
      </li>

      <li>(10?) Redesign GUI so it is more like Eclipse? </li>

      <li>(10?) Is the goal of 5% code reduction being attempted
	through re-design or re-coding? Is it described well-enough?
	
      </li>
      <li>Keeping jEdit's Java code up-to-date 
	with the latest Java belongs in your Implementation report.
	
      </li>
      <li>(10?) Redesign for maintainability, etc. 
	? Or is maintainability of existing jEdit mostly a matter of re-coding? 
	Defend these views.
	
      </li>

      <li>(10?) Tech Report (TR) style minimal requirements? This is
	not a course on Technical Writing.  But all project documents
	submitted are expected to be TRs. I  did not take off points so
	far; but, I will in future.  Even if you are not a
	thesis/dissertation student, read these pages:
	<a href="http://www.wright.edu/graduate-school/graduate-thesis-and-dissertation-handbook-procedures">
	  http://www.wright.edu/ graduate-school/ graduate-thesis -and- 
	  dissertation- handbook- procedures </a></li>

      <li>How are the various pieces of design 
	(sections in this document) relate to previous documents? </li>

      <li>Even in the presence of all kinds of 
	diagrams, pseudo code of core methods must be present in a design doc. 
	Choosing an almost-Java notation defeats the purpose, even though we 
	cannot give a general rule about how high its level should be. </li>

      <li>Design by Contract should/must be 
	practiced in this doc! This is not a question of math logic formalism. 
	It is about complete, and precise (-enough) descriptions. Include&nbsp; 
	(strong enough) class invariants. E.g., what properties do the views 
	maintained by jEdit have? Such as: a view displays a portion of the 
	content of a buffer; the &quot;dot&quot; cursor is within the view; the buffer is 
	the (modified) content of a (an existing) file.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>There was no Implementation Document written for jEdit&nbsp; by
      its authors apart from miscellaneous notes and info in the
      mailing list.  Describe jEdit implementation as it exists.&nbsp;
      Include code modifications that you have made so that it is now
      more compliant with the latest Java, more maintainable, and
      reduced in size.&nbsp; Describe also the implementation of Your
      Plugin.&nbsp; Include in your turnin a tar-ball of all source
      code.</p>


    <h2>Testing</h2>

    <p>[The following is added on Mar 26, 2013]</p>

    <ol>
      <li>There was no Testing Document written for jEdit&nbsp; by its
	authors, apart from the bug reports in forums and email lists.
      <li>This report documents the testing performed on (a piece of)
	  software.  At a minimum, we expect it to report on a smoke
	  test that assures that it is not wholly broken, a black-box
	  acceptance testing, a few stress tests that take the
	  software to its limits, and several white-box tests of the
	  internal units that are in the software.  We also expect to
	  read a statement of code coverage.  This report should
	  always describe all tests that cause failures.  Recall that
	  (the state of software development is such that) we find
	  most software useful even after knowing it fails.

      <li>Acceptance/Conformance tests are part of a Spec.  Even if
	you did not include them then, do so now in this report. </li>

      <li>Unit and Integration Testing should/must be practiced and reported
	in this part of the project work
      </li>

      <li> Lack of time prevents us from a code review.  Redesign and
	  re-coding for maintainability would have been examined
	  then.
      </li>
      <li>Before using this section as a check list, please review
	  the two CS7140 lectures on testing and also a chapter or two
	  from a software engineering (academic) text book (no matter
	  what amazon.com reviews might say).  Recall Dijkstra's
	  quote.  Another: "Absence of evidence does not imply
	  evidence of absence."

      <li>(10 points) Having used jEdit for a week or so, a
	fellow developer is impressed.  (S)he is wondering if jEdit
	should be added to her/his tool chest based on reading your
	"test report". How well does reading your document help? </li>

      <li>(10) Interactive programs, such as modern text editors, can
	be black-box tested treating them as servers and developing a
	test-client that feeds test inputs.  "Typing/Mousing" such
	inputs is just too tedious.  We skipped this topic in CS7140.
	So, do what you can based on your intuition, reading the bug
	reports, email lists, and what you may have learned in a
	prerequisite course.

      <li>(30) Unit testing (JUnit or TestNG) of selected classes (2
	files/student) of jEdit. Recall that Home Work 2 permits the
	work you did there to be included here.

      <li>(30) The testing of Your Plugin: This is new and
	yours. Carefully chosen black-box tests, JUnit white-box tests
	(of all classes of this plugin), and code coverage tests are
	expected.      </li>

      <li>(10) Include snapshots so that the redesigned GUI is seen
	to be more like that of Eclipse. </li>

      <li>(10) This report is a Tech Report (TR).  Read the TR item in
	the Design section above.  Include your journal as an
	Appendix.

    </ol>

    <h2>Final Report</h2>

    <p>This TR is essentially an assembly of all the previous reports,
      which now become chapters.  Merge all the References into one.
      Include a new and brief first chapter that describes the overall
      report.  Include a new final chapter that details any changes
      made to both the previous reports and the source code after
      their turn ins.  Include your journal as an Appendix.
