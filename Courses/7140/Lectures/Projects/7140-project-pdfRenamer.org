Let us name the primary piece of software resulting from this project
as =pdfrenamer=.

** Test PDFs

1. I asked each of you to contribute 5 test PDFs.
1. Done, but they are not all on GitHub.  Why not??
1. They are not annotated, showing fields of interest.

** Requirements

1. Both teams have submitted.  Below are the links.
1. [[https://github.com/MasterGeese/CS7140/blob/master/Requirements.pdf][Jonathan + Sarker]]
1. [[https://github.com/md-k-sarker/PDF-Renamer/blob/master/Requirement/Requirements_v0.0.4_team_of_3.pdf][Apoorva + Jayant + Sarker]]

** Reviews of Requirements

1. Each student reviewed the Req Doc of the other team.
1. Five reviews done.  Quite "reasonable" reviews.


* By The Final Week

1. Previous Reports: (i) Requirements, (ii) Specifications, (iii) Design,
   (iv) Implementation, (v) Testing.

1. The final report for the project is essentially an assembly of all
   the previous reports, which now become chapters, revised if
   necessary.  This is the 6th report.

1. Crucial are the Final Report, and the demonstrable piece of
   software: =pdfrenamer=.

1. All six reports are to be submitted. As I said several times, due
   dates can be negotiated -- but, not beyond the end of term.

* The Next Few Weeks

1. The next milestone is the specification.
1. We discussed what Domain Analysis is, and why we do it.  For our
   project, is it clear enough in your thinking?  Are you familiar
   enough with the PDF libraries?  Can you name the
   PDF-extraction-operations mnemonically?  Are you ready to
   rigorously (even without math and logic) specify?  If you could,
   that would make the core of the Spec Doc.

** Specification

1. My assessment on Mar 15 was that you are not ready to do Specs.
   But, I did not say so in class.  Instead, I gave a constructive
   suggestion.

** Suggested Work

1. Combine the two Requirements Docs into one, benefiting from the
   reviews.  Also, include domain analysis.  Let us call this RDv2.
   Use RDv2 as the basis for remaining work.

1. Intuitive discussion of domain analyses is necessary, but not
   sufficient.  Develop "trial" implementations of the
   PDF-extraction-operations.  This will constitute neither a Spec nor
   a Design.  

1. I hope to discuss Test Driven Development (TDD) and Agile
   Development soon.  These are relevant to the above.

1. Write a TR documenting the above effort.  I did not give a name to
   this TR.  I said [something to the effect that] submit this instead
   of Specs.

1. The due date was Mar 17, which was extended to Mar 18.  I am
   composing this note around 9:00 PM.  So, the due date of Mar 18
   11:59 PM does not seem feasible.  Which is OK.  You come up with a
   due date, and we discuss this quickly on Mar 20.  Obviously, the
   due date of Mar 18 is dropped.
