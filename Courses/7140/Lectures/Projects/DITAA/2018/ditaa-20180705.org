* DITAA Testing Doc

1. Read the Summer 2018 Project Work Testing, Section #10.  The
   following are additional expectations.

2. This doc should describe the testing performed by the authors of
   DITAA main and the EPS plugin.

3. We are expecting to do about 1000 tests.  The collection of tests
   and actual testing, but not the docs, is collaborative work between
   the teams.

4. This doc should have a chapter that describes how the tests were
   collected/ generated/ ...

4. This doc should describe tests under chapters named below.  Choose
   an order of chapters that appeals to you.  This is not team-
   collaborative work.  

   1. Smoke Test [should have 100% coverage] [include known examples of
      hangs and crashes]
   2. Conformance/ Acceptance Tests [should be part of Requirements and
      Specs]
   3. Unit tests [for every class]
   4. Integration tests [focusing on your integration of EPS with DITAA
      main]
   5. Regression tests
   6. Fuzzing  [highly encouraged, but optional]

5. This doc should include an appendix of all test inputs, their
   expected outputs, and the observed output (if different).  Do not
   be alarmed by its size.
   1. The first few pages of the appendix is a table of (at least two
      columns).
   2. First column shows links to test input files.  Name a test input
      file as in nnn-td.txt, nnn a 3-digit test number, td a one-word
      description of the test.
   3. Second column shows links to expected output of the test of this
      row.  Name a test expected output file as in nnn-expected.txt,
      nnn a 3-digit test number, expected is literally "expected".
   4. Third and higher columns show links to actual observed outputs
      of tests.
   5. Page 1 of this Appendix should describe how the test was carried
      out.  E.g., describe the scripts, IDE details.
   6. A tar-ball of all the test files should be uploaded to a cloud
      storage, with the link included in this appendix.
