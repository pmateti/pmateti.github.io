<h1>Project Work</h1>

Some details may change.

<h2>Summer 2015</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Because of the varied mix of students we have this term, the
    project is revised.

    You will be given the source code files of a working text editor
    written in either C++ or Java.  You will be asked to critique it
    and make various improvements.

  <li>Project is based on the source code of MicroEmacs
    <a href="http://www.jasspa.com/downsrc.html">
    http://www.jasspa.com/downsrc.html</a>.  You may also wish to see
    nano, etc.  These can readily be installed on a Linux PC.

  <li>
    Our overall goal is to "redo" a new editor written in Scala aimed
    at programmers.

</ol>

<h2>Common to All Semesters</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    We are using the above as a starting point of a software project
    for this course.  It is complex enough that we could not have
    developed it if we started afresh to design and build it.  We hope
    to contribute to the project at-large the various missing pieces
    that a class room software engineering expects to be there --
    e.g., the various documents.

  <li>The above is/are written in C/C++/Java.  Download the open
    source code, latest version, build it and use it well enough to
    understand its capabilities.

  <li>
    Project work in this course is done by <b>small teams</b>.  Form
    into teams of at most 3 people.  I will be willing to adjust the
    "quantity" of work if you happen to form into teams of just two.

  <li>
    You will be expected to use tools such as Eclipse, Intellij Idea,
    git, make, ant, JML, and others introduced in the next few weeks.

  <li>
    There are 6 tech reports (Requirements, Specifications, Design,
    Implementation, Testing, and Final Report), 5% each, due at
    various stages of the project.  The due dates are/ will-be on the
    course home page.

  <li>This is not a course on Technical Writing.  But all project
    documents submitted are expected to be TRs.  Even if you are not a
    thesis/dissertation student, read these pages:
    <a href="http://www.wright.edu/graduate-school/graduate-thesis-and-dissertation-handbook-procedures">
      wright.edu/ graduate- thesis -and- dissertation-
      handbook- procedures</a>.   

  <li>
    Each of you should maintain a journal and include the journals of
    all your team members in every TR as an Appendix.

  <li>Peer reviews.  Each of you is expected to critique the documents
    submitted by another group.  So that this is really useful, the
    critique should be submitted within a week of receiving the
    document.

  <li>The numbers inside parens are weights; you can think of the
    number also as the maximum possible score for that item.  These
    max numbers may add up to &gt; 100.  The Score Earned per each of
    the six phases is computed as follows: (Sum of the Item Scores
    Earned)/(Sum of the Item Max Scores)*100.

  <li>Late penalty is 2% per day late, Sat and Sun counted.  Five days
    after the due date, no submission is accepted.  If you have a
    special situation, discuss it before not afterwards.  Late
    submissions due to computer systems being glitchy, etc. are
    forgiven.

</ol>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    All of you must address the items below in your Requirements
    Document.  Some of these are subjective -- make them as objective
    as possible.

  <li>Limit yourself to dealing with plain text and
    C/C++/ Java/ Scala editing, and plugin support.

  <li>(40) There was no Requirements Document written for Project by its
    authors.  Pretending that Project implementation does not exist yet,
    write this document addressing existing features and the items
    discussed in this section.
  <li>(20) Describe an improved GUI look-and-feel (e.g., to match
    Eclipse).
  <li>(20) Develop a new and useful feature/ improvement/ plugin.  It is
    expected that different teams will propose different things.
  <li>(20) Describe code maintainablity expectations.
  <li> (20) Describe the expectations of "By the end of Testing Phase"
    (see Testing section).
  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.
  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Requirements documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<ol>
  <li> (50) There was no Specifications Document written for Project by
    its authors.  Pretending that Project implementation does not
    exist yet, write this document addressing existing features and
    the items listed in Requirements.
  <li> (20) Acceptance/Conformance tests are part of a Spec.
  <li> (20) Rigor and mathematical logic.
  <li>(10) Every modern text editor has buffers, cursors,
    view-windows, cut-paste-containers, kbd + mouse input methods,
    undo/redo, ... Did this doc describe their spec?

  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.
  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Specs documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Design</h2>

<ol>
  <li> (20) There was no Design Document written for Project by its
    authors.  You are extracting &quot;the&quot; design of Project from
    its existing implementation in Java in the absence of Req, Spec,
    and Design documents by Project 's authors. 

  <li>It is not enough that you feel you understood the design of the
    core of Project well enough.  You need to articulate it in the
    submitted doc. 

  <li>(10 points) Having used Project for a week or so, a fellow
    developer is now interested in understanding how it is
    designed. (S)he already finished reading your Req and Specs, and
    is now reading your Design Doc. Assume that (s)he also knows about
    how editors are typically designed: buffers, cursors, etc. How
    well does reading your document help? 

  <li>(10) Every modern text editor has buffers, cursors,
    view-windows, cut-paste-containers, kbd + mouse input methods,
    undo/redo, ... Did this doc describe their design?

  <li>(10) The design of Your Plugin.  This is new and yours. So more
    detail and precision is expected. Carefully chosen pseudo code,
    diagrams, etc. are expected.

  <li>(10) Redesign GUI so it is more like Eclipse 

  <li>(05) Is the goal of 5% code reduction being attempted
    through re-design or re-coding? Is it described well-enough?  

  <li>(05) Do a code review of the existing code.  Report on redesign
    and re-coding for maintainability.  Keeping Project's Java code
    up-to-date with the latest Java belongs in your Implementation
    report. 


  <li> (20) Design by Contract should/must be practiced in this
    doc. This is not just a question of math logic formalism.  It is
    about complete, and precise (-enough) descriptions, perhaps in
    English.  Include (strong enough) class invariants.  E.g., what
    properties do the views maintained by Project have? Such as: a view
    displays a portion of the content of a buffer; the &quot;dot&quot;
    cursor is within the view; the buffer is the (modified) content of
    a (an existing) file.

  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.

  <li>How are the various pieces of design 
    (sections in this document) relate to previous documents? 

  <li>Even in the presence of all kinds of diagrams, pseudo code of
    core methods must be present in a design doc.  Choosing an
    almost-Java notation defeats the purpose, even though we cannot
    give a general rule about how high its level should be. 
  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Design documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<ol>
  <li> (20) Describe Project implementation not only as it exists, but
    also including the code modifications that you have made so that
    it is now more compliant with the latest Java, more
    maintainable, and reduced in size.  Describe also the
    implementation of Your Plugin.  

  <li>There was no Implementation Report written for  Project  
    by its authors, apart from the bug reports in forums and email
    lists.

  <li> (20) Include in your turnin a tar-ball of all source code.
    It should build cleanly.  Do the equivalent of "make clean"
    and then include an "ls -lR" style listing of files.  It
    should include a How To Build section.  Include size details
    of the system built.

  <li>(30) The implementation of Your Plugin: This is new and
    yours.   Include any details, beyond what was in Design Report.
  

  <li> (10) Include in this TR a short report of a "smoke test." Other
    testing such as Unit and Integration Testing are part of the
    Test Report.
  

  <li>(10) Include snapshots so that the redesigned GUI is seen
    to be more like that of Eclipse. 

  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li> (10) Tech Report (TR) style.

  <li> (15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Implementation documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<ol>

  <li>There was no Testing Document written for  Project   by its
    authors, apart from the bug reports in forums and email lists.

  <li> This report documents the testing performed on (a piece of)
    software.  At a minimum, we expect it to report on a smoke
    test that assures that it is not wholly broken, a black-box
    acceptance testing, a few stress tests that take the
    software to its limits, and several white-box tests of the
    internal units that are in the software.  We also expect to
    read a statement of code coverage.  This report should
    always describe all tests that cause failures.  Recall that
    (the state of software development is such that) we find
    most software useful even after knowing it fails.

  <li>Acceptance/Conformance tests are/were part of a Spec.

  <li>Unit and Integration Testing should/must be practiced and reported
    in this part of the project work.

  <li>Before using this section as a check list, please review
    the two CS7140 lectures on testing and also a chapter or two
    from a software engineering (academic) text book (no matter
    what amazon.com reviews might say).  Recall Dijkstra's
    quote.  Another: "Absence of evidence does not imply
    evidence of absence."

  <li>(10 points) Having used  Project  for a week or so, a
    fellow developer is impressed.  (S)he is wondering if  Project 
    should be added to her/his tool chest based on reading your
    "test report". How well does reading your document help? 

  <li>(10) Interactive programs, such as modern text editors, can
    be black-box tested treating them as servers and developing a
    test-client that feeds test inputs.  "Typing/Mousing" such
    inputs is just too tedious.  We skipped this topic in CS7140.
    So, do what you can based on your intuition, reading the bug
    reports, email lists, and what you may have learned in a
    prerequisite course.

  <li>(30) Unit testing (JUnit or TestNG) of selected classes (2
    files/student) of  Project . Recall that Home Work 2 permits the
    work you did there to be included here.

  <li>(30) The testing of Your Plugin: This is new and
    yours. Carefully chosen black-box tests, JUnit white-box tests
    (of all classes of this plugin), and code coverage tests are
    expected.      

  <li>(10) Include snapshots so that the redesigned GUI is seen
    to be more like that of Eclipse.

  <li>By the end of Testing Phase:
    <ol type=i>
      <li> (30) Discover and fix at least one bug (not found by any one
	else) per team member (or throw in your claim that Project is
	bug-free).
      <li> (20) Improve the maintainability of Project.  Describe as many of
	these improvements as possible.  During the semester, we will
	discuss several subtopics of maintenance.
      <li> (20) Reduce Project code size. It should be at least 5% smaller (as
	measured through the .class files) than what it is now. Please
	look up on how to measure byte code size from class files ignoring
	all meta data.  The reduction in size is excluding the code of
	Your Plugin.
    </ol>
  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.

  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Testing documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Final Report</h2>

<ol>
  <li> This TR is essentially an assembly of all the previous reports,
    which now become chapters, revised if necessary.  

  <li>(20)
    Include a new and brief first chapter that describes the overall
    report.  

  <li>(20)Include a new semi-final chapter that details any changes
    made to both the previous reports and the source code after their
    turnins.

  <li>(20) Include a new final chapter that describes your experience/
    hindsight of this project.
  <li> (20) Merge all the References into one.
  <li> (10) Include your cumulative journals as a merged Appendix.

  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.
  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Requirements documents submitted by another group.
