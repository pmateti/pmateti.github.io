<h2>Project Goals</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Enahancing/ Correcting existing code is the daily grind for a
   software engineer. One should learn to engineer software so that it
   is easy to carry this out.  A complementary skill is to know when
   to treat a portion of code as black box, and when to treat it as a
   transparent box.

 <li>Overview of <a href=../Lectures/Maintenance> software maintenance</a>

 <li>Every student, especially, graduate students, of software
   engineering should "study" the spec/design/impl of 100+ KLOC
   programs.  How deeply? Depends on individual ability and available
   time.  Unfortunately, for no open source project that I know of has
   spec/design documents.

 <li>Careless thinking causes bugs. Can you see this carelessness in the
   code of our chosen project?  What portion can we attribute to
   design? to spec? to requirements?

 <li>Our team project will be to take an open source project, that
   is/was quite popular, and improve it.

 <li>Official contributions to the project are certainly welcome, but
   this is not a "graded" goal.
</ol>

<h2>Teams</h2>

<ol>

  <li>
    Project work in this course is done by <b>small teams</b>.  Form
    into teams of three people.  I will be willing to adjust the
    "quantity" of work if you could not form into a team of three.

  <li> Even so,  there are no lectures on "team work".

  <li>Choose your team mates carefully.  We have seen teams losing
    members because of course drops.
  <li> It is your responsibility to bring to my attention when some
    team member is not contributing equally.
</ol>

<h2>Common to All Semesters</h2>

<ol>
  <li>You will be given the name of a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">
    FOSS</a>. It would have been written in C/C++/Java.  Download the
    open source code, latest version, build it and use it well enough
    to understand its capabilities.

  <li>This collection of src code files is a starting point of a
    software project for this course.  It is complex enough that we
    could not have developed it if we started afresh to design and
    build it.  We hope to contribute to the project at-large the
    various missing pieces that a class room software engineering
    expects to be there -- e.g., the various documents.

  <li>
    You will be expected to use tools such as Intellij Idea, Eclipse,
    git, make, ant, gradle, JML, KeY, and others introduced in the
    next few weeks.

  <li>
    There are 6 tech reports (Requirements, Specifications, Design,
    Implementation, Testing, and Final Report), 5% each, due at
    various stages of the project.  The due dates are/ will-be on the
    course home page.

  <li>This is not a course on Technical Writing.  Nevertheless, all project
    documents submitted are expected to be TRs.  Even if you are not a
    thesis/dissertation student, read these pages:
    <a href="http://www.wright.edu/graduate-school/graduate-thesis-and-dissertation-handbook-procedures">
      wright.edu/ graduate- thesis -and- dissertation-
      handbook- procedures</a>.   

  <li>
    Each of you should maintain a
    <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Daily-Journal">
      journal</a>.  Include the journals of all your team members in
    every TR as an Appendix.

  <li>Peer reviews.  Each of you is expected to critique the documents
    submitted by another group.  So that this is really useful, the
    critique should be submitted within a week of receiving the
    document.  We will workout further details in class.

  <li>The numbers inside parens are weights.  This number is also the
    maximum possible score for that item.  These max numbers may add
    up to &gt; 100.  The Score Earned per each of the six phases is
    computed as follows: (Sum of the Item Scores Earned)/(Sum of the
    Item Max Scores)*100.

  <li>Late penalty is 2% per day late, Sat and Sun counted.  Five days
    after the due date no submission is accepted.  If you have a
    special situation, discuss it before, not afterwards.  Late
    submissions due to computer systems being glitchy, etc. are
    forgiven.

</ol>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>A Requirements Document describes the software project at its
  conception.  It is written from the users perspective.  In fact, it is
  good idea to actually write a first draft of a Users Manual and
  include it as an appendix.  It justifies why it is worthwhile to do
  it.  Unless the project topic is well known, such as editors,
  compilers, etc., it should expalin where it is coming from.

<p>In this course, we will almost always be starting from the source
  code of an already implemented project.  So, we pretend that it is
  yet to be constructed.

<p>In large projects, requirements elicitation is a major and
  difficult task.  Often requirements become clearer after a prototype
  has been built.

<p>We cannot really give a template as requirements depend on the
  given project.  Marsic's book has an example as an appendix.  Do a
  web search for examples.  There are some decent answers on
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"> http://stackoverflow.com/</a>.

<p>Related terms: Requirements Definition, Requirements Specification,
  Requirements Elicitation, Requirements Analysis.

<p> (The numbers in parentheses indicate relative weight.  They may/
    do not add up to a 100.)

<ol>
  <li> All of you must address the items below in your Requirements
    Document.  Some of these are subjective -- make them as objective
    as possible.

  <li>(40) There was no Requirements Document written for Our Project by its
    authors.  Pretending that Project implementation does not exist yet,
    write this document addressing existing features and the items
    discussed in this section.
  <li>(20) Describe an improved GUI look-and-feel.

  <li>(20) Develop a new and useful feature/ improvement/ plugin.  It is
    expected that different teams will propose different things.
  <li>(20) Describe code maintainablity expectations.
  <li> (20) Describe the expectations of "By the end of Testing Phase"
    (see Testing section).
  <li> (20) Of course, Our Project is already designed and built.  A
    goal that is imposed on you is 5% code reduction.  If this is not
    doable, it is your responsibility to convince me and your peer reviewers.
  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.
  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Requirements documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Specifications</h2>

<ol>
  <li> (50) There was no Specifications Document written for Our Project by
    its authors.  Pretending that Project implementation does not
    exist yet, write this document addressing existing features and
    the items listed in Requirements.
  <li> (20) Acceptance/Conformance tests are part of a Spec.
  <li> (20) Rigor and mathematical logic.
  <li>(10) Suppose our project is an Editor.  Every modern text editor
    has buffers, cursors, view-windows, cut-paste-containers, kbd +
    mouse input methods, undo/redo, ... What are the essential pieces
    to Our Project this term?  Did this doc describe their spec? What
    are the essential pieces to Our Project this term?
  <li> (20) Quality of the spec of 5% code reduction.  Objectively
    stated? Subjective? Can it be verified through some tools?
  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.
  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Specs documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Design</h2>

<ol>
  <li> (20) There was no Design Document written for Our Project by its
    authors.  You are extracting &quot;the&quot; design of Project from
    its existing implementation in Java in the absence of Req, Spec,
    and Design documents by Project 's authors. 

  <li>It is not enough that you feel you understood the design of the
    core of Project well enough.  You need to articulate it in the
    submitted doc. 

  <li>(20) Having used Our Project for a week or so, a fellow
    developer is now interested in understanding how it is
    designed. (S)he already finished reading your Req and Specs, and
    is now reading your Design Doc.  Suppose our project is an Editor.
    Assume that (s)he also knows about how editors are typically
    designed: buffers, cursors, etc. How well does reading your
    document help?  Similarly, assume that (s)he is generally familiar
    with the class of programs that Our Projects belongs.  How well
    does your doc cater to this need?

  <li>(10) The design of Your "Plugin".  This is new and yours. So
    more detail and precision, compared to other sections of this doc,
    is expected.  Carefully chosen pseudo code, diagrams, etc. are
    expected.  The meaning of "plugin" is now well-known; e.g., as in
    Eclipse or IntelliJ plugins.

  <li>(10) Redesign the GUI so it is more familiar/ better.

  <li>(05) Is the goal of 5% code reduction being attempted
    through re-design or re-coding? Is it described well-enough?  

  <li>(05) Do a code review of the existing code.  Report on redesign
    and re-coding for maintainability.  Keeping Project's Java code
    up-to-date with the latest Java belongs in your Implementation
    report. 

  <li> (20) Design by Contract should/must be practiced in this
    doc. This is not just a question of math logic formalism.  It is
    about complete, and precise (-enough) descriptions, perhaps in
    English.  Include (strong enough) class invariants.  E.g., what
    properties do the views maintained by Project have? Such as: a view
    displays a portion of the content of a buffer; the &quot;dot&quot;
    cursor is within the view; the buffer is the (modified) content of
    a (an existing) file.

  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.

  <li>How are the various pieces of design 
    (sections in this document) relate to previous documents? 

  <li>Even in the presence of all kinds of diagrams, pseudo code of
    core methods must be present in a design doc.  Choosing an
    almost-Java notation defeats the purpose, even though we cannot
    give a general rule about how high its level should be. 
  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Design documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<ol>
  <li>There was no Implementation Report written for  Project  
    by its authors, apart from the bug reports in forums and email
    lists.

  <li> (20) Describe Project implementation not only as it exists, but
    also including the code modifications that you have made so that
    it is now more compliant with the latest Java, more maintainable,
    and reduced in size.  Describe also the implementation of Your
    Plugin.  You are welcome to use tools such as Doxygen.

  <li> (20) Include in your turnin a tar-ball of all source code.
    It should build cleanly.  Do the equivalent of "make clean"
    and then include an "ls -lR" style listing of files.  It
    should include a How To Build section.  Include size details
    of the system built.

  <li>(30) The implementation of Your Plugin: This is new and yours.
    Include details beyond what was in Design Report.  Do not
    duplicate -- just cite the Design Report sections.
  
  <li> (10) Include in this TR a short report of a "smoke test."  Other
    testing such as Unit and Integration Testing are part of the
    Test Report.

  <li>(10) Include snapshots so that the redesigned GUI is seen
    to be more familiar/ better.

  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li> (10) Tech Report (TR) style.

  <li> (15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Implementation documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<ol>

  <li>There was no Testing Document written for Our Project by its
    authors, apart from the bug reports in forums and email lists.

  <li> This report documents the testing performed on our project, as
    revised by you.  At a minimum, we expect it to report on (i) a
    smoke test that assures that it is not wholly broken, (ii) a
    black-box acceptance testing, (iii) a few stress tests that take
    the software to its limits, and (iv) several white-box tests of
    the internal units that are in the software.  We also expect to
    read a statement of code coverage.  This report should always
    describe, at some length, all tests that cause failures.  Recall
    that (the state of software engineering is such that) we find most
    software useful even after knowing it fails.

  <li>Acceptance/Conformance tests are/were part of a Spec.

  <li>Unit and Integration Testing should/must be practiced and reported
    in this part of the project work.

  <li>Before using this section as a check list, please review the
    CS7140 lectures on Testing and also a chapter or two from a
    software engineering (academic) text book (no matter what
    amazon.com reviews might say).  Recall Dijkstra's quote: "Testing
    shows the presence, not the absence of bugs".  Another: "Absence
    of evidence does not imply evidence of absence."

  <li>(10 points) Having used Our Project for a week or so, a fellow
    developer is impressed.  (S)he is wondering if Our Project should
    be added to her/his tool chest based on reading your "test
    report". How well does reading your document help?

  <li>(10) Interactive programs, such as modern text editors, can be
    black-box tested treating them as servers and developing a
    test-client that feeds test inputs.  "Typing/Mousing" such inputs
    is just too tedious.  [We skipped this topic in past CS7140.]  So,
    do what you can based on your intuition, reading the bug reports,
    email lists, and what you may have learned in a prerequisite
    course.

  <li>(30) Unit testing (JUnit or TestNG) of selected classes (2
    files/student) of Our Project.  Recall that Home Work 2 permits
    the work you did there to be included here.

  <li>(30) The testing of Your Plugin: This is new and
    yours. Carefully chosen black-box tests, JUnit/TestNG white-box
    tests (of all classes of this plugin), and code coverage tests are
    expected.

  <li>(10) Include snapshots so that the redesigned GUI is seen
    to be more familiar/ better.

  <li>By the end of Testing Phase:
    <ol type=i>
      <li> (30) Discover and fix at least one bug (not found by any one
	else) per team member (or throw in your claim that Project is
	bug-free).
      <li> (20) Improve the maintainability of Project.  Describe as many of
	these improvements as possible.  During the semester, we will
	discuss several subtopics of maintenance.
      <li> (20) Reduce Project code size. It should be at least 5% smaller (as
	measured through the .class files) than what it is now. Please
	look up on how to measure byte code size from class files ignoring
	all meta data.  The reduction in size is excluding the code of
	Your Plugin.
    </ol>
  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.

  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the
    Testing documents submitted by another group.
</ol>

<h2>Final Report</h2>

<ol>
  <li> This TR is essentially an assembly of all the previous reports,
    which now become chapters, revised if necessary.  

  <li>(20)
    Include a new and brief first chapter that describes the overall
    report.  

  <li>(20)Include a new semi-final chapter that details any changes
    made to both the previous reports and the source code after their
    turnins.

  <li>(20) Include a new final chapter that describes your experience/
    hindsight of this project.
  <li> (20) Merge all the References into one.
  <li> (10) Include your cumulative journals as a merged Appendix.

  <li> (30) Journals of your team members.
  <li>(10) Tech Report (TR) style.
  <li>(15) Separate critiques by your team members of the Final
    Reports submitted by another group.
