* Problem Statement

1. Read [[./index.org]] first.

* Implementation in Java

1. [[./GEN/SmallSet.java][SmallSet.java]] | [[./GEN/SmallSet.java.html][html]] | [[./GEN/SmallSet.java.pdf][pdf]] | [[./GEN]] This is a link to a Java
   implementation.  Possibly contains bugs.  It is also intended as an
   example for use later with learning assertions, JUnit/TestNG, PMD,
   FindBugs, and other tools.

* Documenting in Java

1. =java -enableassertions ...=

1. =javadoc=  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/

* Abstraction Function

1.  =setOfA(s)= is the abstraction function that yields the
    mathematical set represented by the Java SmallSet object =s=.
1.  =setOfA(SmallSet s) === =setOf(s.ear[0..s.ux -1])=
1. +Overloaded.+

* Class Invariants

1. =classInv(s)= is both a pre- and a post-condition for all public
   methods; see the src code.
1. It is a post-condition for constructors.
1. It is a convention not to state this again and again for each
   public method.

1. For private methods, state it as needed.

* Java Assert Practical Issues
