* Abstract

This note describes the req/ spec/ design of a (small/ fixed size) set
of integers.  This is expected to be a good example of software
engineering design "in the tiny".  There is also a link to a Java
implementation.  

* SmallSet Requirements

1. A set is a concept from discrete mathematics.
1. "smallset": No bigger than, say, 1000 elements.
1. Insertion "fails" beyond 1000.
1. This SmallSet is NOT the same as Java Set container.


** SmallSet Operations: Names

1. For now, just the names
   1. construct-empty-set (or cons)
   1. insert-an-item, delete-an-item
   1. item-is-in-the-set
   1. number-of-items-in-the-set
   1. union-with, diff-with
1. All the above should be well-specified
1. ignored detail:  item ==> int
1. all the above converges to "API"

** SmallSet Operations: Signatures
   1. insert-an-item: Set, Item --> Set
   1. delete-an-item: Set, Item --> Set
   1. item-is-in-the-set: Set, Item --> Boolean
   1. number-of-items-in-the-set: Set --> Integer
   1. union-with: Set, Set --> Set
   1. diff-with: Set, Set --> Set
   1. construct-empty-set: --> Set

** SmallSet Requirements Clarifications

1. Insertions are far more frequent cf to other ops  
1. item-is-in-the-set(S, e): searched for again often


* SmallSet Operations: Semantics

1. Should we describe semantics here in the requirements?
1. We decided to just depend on what discrete math tells us.
