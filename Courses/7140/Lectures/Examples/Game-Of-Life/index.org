* Conway's Game of Life

1. Any live cell with

  1. < 2 live neighbours dies  (as if caused by under-population).
  1. 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  1. > 3 live neighbours dies (as if by over-population).

1. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live
   cell (as if by reproduction).

1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

** GUI Needs of GoL

1. A (stationary) grid of cells; infinite in x and y axes
1. Draw/Erase a cell; filled? color?
1. Control: speed, size, ...
1. Themes: colors, circle, square, ...
1. Kbd/Mouse/Touch interface
1. Extensible (plugins)

** Observations

1. Inherently concurrent
1. Systolic (as in heart beat)
1. Non-Trivial: Correct implementation of the rules
1. Non-Trivial: Infinite grid
1. Non-Trivial: Detecting rule applicability

* Open Source GoL Implementations

** Edwin Martin's  Implementation

1. http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/code
1. A quick tour
   1. Java files 18, xml files 2
   1. Java SLOC 1549, xml SLOC 769
1. Browse [[./Edwin-Martin/html/StandaloneGameOfLife_8java_source.html][Game-Of-Life]] files generated by [[https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/starting.html][Doxygen]]
1. Uses Java JDK 1.1
1. =import java.awt.*=

** Other Implementations

1. https://github.com/Dricus/game-of-life "A small practice project
   for doing Test Driven Development and doing basic 2D stuff with
   JavaFX."  Java, JavaFX and XML; Open Source Code, 2014

1. http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/ Javascript,
   Canvas

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti8cXWvclKo&list by
   "ForseenParadox"; cliams to have programmed in 1 hour while video
   recording

1. Google Play for Android has several APKs.  Probably not open
   source.

* Game of Life Redo

1. Re-write/ Refactor/ Annotate/ Document GoL
1. Concurrent design and implementation
1. Event driven design and implementation
1. Wiki has several patterns -- all these must "work"
1. Tabs, one GoL running in each
1. Look elegant
1. A portion of the above is Lab L2
1. http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/88783/build-a-digital-clock-in-conways-game-of-life/

* Concurrency

1. Non-Trivial: Correct implementation of the rules
1. Inherently concurrent
1. The rules must be evaluated concurrently.
1. Assuming systolic (i.e., like a heart beat) updates

* References

1. https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life GoL is
   programmed in many PLs.
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
1. https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ A respectable implementation.
   Uses old Java.
