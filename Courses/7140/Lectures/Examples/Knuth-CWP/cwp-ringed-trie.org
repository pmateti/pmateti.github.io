1. Why introduce this design? Two pointers per node: to-sibling,
   to-head-of-children.

1. Siblings and a new header node are in a ring.  We introduced a
   header node (shown as a circle), whose to-sibling points to the
   oldest.  Each node's to-sibling points to its immediate younger
   sibling.
1. Parent's to-head-of-children points to the header of the siblings.
1. Technically, this is not a tree. ("ring").
1. Root's to-sibling is null.

* Operations

1. insertWord(w)
1. What other operations must we design?
