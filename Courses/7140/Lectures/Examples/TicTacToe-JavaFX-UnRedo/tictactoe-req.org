Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a grid of 3x3 cells.  All cells begin as
blank cells.  Two players, the X-player, the O-player, alternate to
place an X ("ex") or O (big-oh) in a blank-cell.  Goal is to have 3 Xs
or 3 Os in a row, in a column, or in a digonal.  The first player to
do so wins.  A game is a draw if all 9 cells are filled without anyone
winning.  Often, we can detect a draw early -- even before all 9 cells
are filled.

This game is traditionally played on paper that passes between the
players.  Design and build an elegant version that can be played on a
two networked computers.

* Discussion/ Exercises

1. Did we commit any of the Seven Sins of the Specifiers?
1. Who must be the first player?
1. We did not say: No player is permitted to erase a non-blank cell.
   Is this silence?
