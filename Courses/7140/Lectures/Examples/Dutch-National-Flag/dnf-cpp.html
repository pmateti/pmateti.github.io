<h2>Dutch National Flag Problem [Dijkstra 1976]</h2>

<p>This is a Correct by Design example from the book by Edsger Wybe
Dijkstra, A Discipline of Programming, Prentice-Hall, 1976.  A
classic.  Has many examples of Correct by Design.  Dijkstra is a
<a href=http://amturing.acm.org/> Turning Award Winner</a> 1972.


<p>
Problem: An array a[1..n] is filled with elements colored red, white
or blue.  Design an algorithm that rearranges the elements so that all
the red-elements are at the left, all the blues are at the right, and
the whites are in the middle.

<p>
Non-functional Requirements: (i) Do not assume that red < white <
blue.  (ii) We are expecting an O(n) algorithm.  (iii) Focus on
assertions.

<p>
Answer: We use a[x .. y] to stand for all elements a[i] such that x <= i
<= y.  When x > y, a[x..y] is empty and we can ascribe any property P
wish to it.  The location of LI is immediately after the "while"
token.

<pre class="brush: cpp">
r = w = 0;
b = n+1;
while
 /*@ LI is a[1..r] is red and a[r+1 .. w] is white and
    a[b..n] is blue @*/
 (w+1 < b) {
  switch (a[w+1]) {
    case white:
      w ++;
      break;
    case red:
      w ++;
      exchange a[w] with a[r+1];
      break;
    case blue:
      b --;
      exchange a[w+1] with a[b];
      break;
  }
}
/*@ w+1 == b and a[1..r] is red and
    a[r+1 .. w] is white and a[b..n] is blue @*/
</pre>

<p>The while loop terminates because the gap (b - w) guaranteedly
decreases in every iteration.

<p>You should also explain why/how the LI remains valid after each of
the switch-cases.

  <h3> Exercise </h3>

  Make the above proper C++, including assertions.  As of now,
  assertions are shown as comments.
