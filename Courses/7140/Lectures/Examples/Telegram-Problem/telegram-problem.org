1. "Write a program that takes a number w, then accepts lines of text
   and outputs lines of text, where the output lines have as many
   words as possible but are never longer than w characters. Words may
   not be split, but you may assume that no single word is too long
   for a line."

1. Originally described in 197x by Peter Naur, 2005 Turing Award
   Winner.

1. This is essentially word-wrapping within a paragraph of a text
   editor.  "As such, it is a classic ObjectOriented problem, used as
   an example in the Design Patterns Book."

1. It is surprisingly difficult to specify correctly, and to design
   a correct program in Java or C++.

1. Do a requirement analysis.  E.g.: What assumptions must we make so that
   this problem is doable?
