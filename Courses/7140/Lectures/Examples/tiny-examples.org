* Tiny.Tiny Examples of Spec/Design

1. [[./Dutch-National-Flag]] Correct by Design example by Dijkstra.
1. [[./Quick-Sort]] Why is it hard to understand and then remember?
1. [[./SmallSet]] A simple implementation of a set of integers.  Shows
   pre/post and class invariants.
1. [[./Condense-Num-Ranges]] E.g., given 2 - 9 and 3 -12, condense to
   2 - 12.  Spec and design.
1. [[./Magic-Squares]] Construct n x n matrix of numbers so that columns,
   rows and diagonals add up to the same number.
1. [[./Tabulate-Equations]] such as a collection from algebra.  Spec and design.
1. [[./Telegram-Problem]] The problem of Peter Naur.  Famous people wrote
   buggy solutions!
1. [[./Worms]] wiggly worms, some vegetarian, others cannibals.  Presented
   as (i) a software "maintenance" problem, and (ii) as an example of
   writing assertions.
1. [[./TicTacToe-JavaFX-UnRedo]] Presented as a software "maintenance"
   problem.  Is it bug free?
1. [[./Game-Of-Life]] Conway's GoL. Presented as a software "maintenance"
   problem.  TBD Incomplete.
1. [[./Columnize-Words]] Part of /bin/ls spec.

1. [[./Mark-Error-Pos]] A required method within a compiler.  Position an
   arrow, and next to it print error numbers.
