1. This list is not meant to be exahaustive.  But relevant to our
   learning goals.

1. EMACS http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/ "GNU Emacs is an
   extensible, customizable text editor -- and more. At its core is an
   interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming
   language with extensions to support text editing."  The current
   stable release is 24.5 (April 2015)

1. Vi http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/ The Traditional Vi Source Code for
   Modern Unix Systems

1. MS NotePad
   https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/aa972157 "This
   sample is a full featured Windows Notepad application with some
   added features ..."

1. MicroEmacs URL TBD

1. A quick to read review of "new style" editors named
   =sublime-text, atom, brackets, light-table=:
   http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/
   "A new breed of editor has arrived. It fills the gaping void
   between basic text applications (Notepad, TextEdit, gedit, etc.)
   and full Integrated Development Environments (VisualStudio,
   Eclipse, NetBeans etc.) Simpler applications lack basic development
   requirements such as multiple documents, line numbering and code
   coloring. IDEs tend to be monolithic applications which cater for a
   specific language, framework or platform." ...
   "Sorry Vi[m] and Emacs fans â€” console-based applications have been excluded"

   Not by an academic. Certainly *not* thorough.

1. https://github.com/scaled/scaled "Scaled is a modern programmer's
   text editor, built atop Java 8 and JavaFX 8, mostly written in
   Scala, ...  Scaled focuses on the text editing experience first,
   and IDE-like features second. ... Scaled is designed to be
   extensible in any JVM language." 

   Active project June 2015.
