A square that is divided into smaller squares, each containing a
number, such that the figures in each vertical, horizontal, and
diagonal row add up to the same value.

The above def showed up on a [[https://www.google.com/webhp?&ion=1#q=magic%20squares][web search]].

1. An n x n magic square that contains the integers from 1 to n^2 is
   called a /normal/ magic square.

1. Construct a program that takes n as an argument and generates a
   normal magic square of n x n.

1. Is this possible to do for all n > 0?  What does it take to prove
   or disprove this?

1. Here is a solution [[./magic.c]] that works for a few odd numbers n,
   for sure as verified by examination of the results.  [Lost author's
   name.  Sorry!]

1. How can you be sure that it works (or not) for all odd n?

1. The file [[./magic-orig.c]] was pretty printed into [[./magic.c]].  Compare
   the two and express your opinions on which one do you prefer to
   read along with a detailed why.
