* Background

** History

1. Quicksort was contributed by Hoare in 1962. Hundreds of subsequent
   papers!

2. Over the decades of teaching, we "know" that only a few students
   understand Quicksort.  Why?  Bad teaching? Poor student?

** Optimal Sorting

2. For an array of size n, the best we can do is O(n lg n).
   Quicksort and Heapsort are both O(n lg n).

1. Our interest is not in the perf analysis.  Nor in the performance
   itself.

** Relevance to SE

1. This is a good example to extrapolate to Software Engineering
   issues.

** Specs

1. Signature: Quicksort(lo, hi).  

1. Array to be sorted: A[] of integers.  Low index 1, high index n.
   Global.  Quicksort(1, n). n >= 1.

1. Notation: A[lo .. hi] stands for the set of elements A[lo], .., A[hi].

1. Pre:: true;; 

1. Post::
   1. hi >= lo and sorted(A, lo, hi) and permuted(A.old, A, lo, hi),
      *or*
   2. hi < lo and A[] is unchanged, i.e., equal(A.old, A, lo, hi).

* Partitioning Idea

1. Quicksort(lo, hi). Focus only on A[lo] .. A[hi].  Assume hi >= lo.
   Leave other elements of A[] untouched.

2. Pick a value z := A[x], lo >= x >= hi.  (The choice of z has an
   impact on performance.)

3. Permute the elements of A[] so that any A[lo .. p] <= z < any A[p+1
   .. hi].
   1. permuted(A.old, A, lo, hi),
   2. p may equal lo - 1 (so A[lo .. p] is empty),
   2. p may equal hi (so A[p+1 .. hi] is empty),

4. Quizz: At the end of the above, is A[x] equal to z?

4. Then do 
   1. Quicksort(1, p)
   2. Quicksort(p+1, n)

5. All of this is elegantly discussed in (cite) [Foley and Hoare 1971].

1. Exercise: Suppose we give you the primitive operation: exchange(i,
   j) that excahnges the i-th element of the array with the j-th
   element.  If we use this op exclusively, the permutation property
   is guaranteed.  Rewrite Quicksort using exchange().  No array[x] :=
   e are permitted.
