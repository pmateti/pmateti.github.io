<h2>Comparison of Defect-Detection Approaches</h2>
insert figure TBD
</section>

<section>
<h2>Inspections?</h2>
<ol>
<li>  The combination of design and code inspections usually
removes 70-85 percent or more of the defects in a prod
uct (Jones 1996).
<li>  Designers and coders learn to improve their work throu
gh participating in inspections, and inspections increase
productivity by about 20 percent (Fagan 1976, Humphrey 1989, Gil
b and Graham 1993, Wiegers 2002).

<li>  On a project that uses inspections for design and code,
the inspections will take up about 10-15 percent of proj
ect budget and will typically reduce overall project cost.
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Best Results – Combine Approaches</h2>
<ol>
<li>  The typical organization uses a test-heavy defe
ct-removal approach and achieves only about
85 percent defect removal efficiency.
<li>  Leading organizations use a wider variety of te
chniques and achieve defect-removal efficienci
es of 95 percent or higher (Gones 2000).
</ol>

<h2>Code Review Tools</h2>
<ol>
<li>  Advantages of Code Review Tools
<li> Track suggestions
<li> Allow follow up on tasks
<li> Aid in comparing before and after changes
<li> Source Code repository integration

<li> Tools [web search to find links]
<ol>
<li> Crucible
<li> CodeCollaborator

<section><h2>Code Analysis Tools</h2>
<ol>
<li> FindBugs
<li> PMD
<li> CheckStyle
<li> Jdepend
<li> Ckjm
<li> Cpd
<li> Javancss
<li> Cobertura
<li> jlint
</ol>
</section>
<section><h2>FindBugs</h2>
<ol>
<li>  A bug pattern is a code idiom that is often an error.
<li> Difficult language features
<li> Misunderstood API methods
<li> Misunderstood invariants when code is maintaine
<li> typos, wrong boolean operators, …

<li>  static analysis to inspect Java bytecode for bug patte
rns.
<li> Without executing the program
<li> don't even need the program's source

<li>  can report false warnings, and also miss real errors.
<li> In practice, false warnings < 50%.
</ol>
</section>
<section><h2>FindBugs Categories</h2>

<ol>
<li> Bad practice
<li> Correctness
<li> Dodgy
<li> Experimental
<li> Internationalization
<li> Malicious code vulnerability
<li> Multithreaded correctness
<li> Performance
<li> Security
</ol>
</section>
<section><h2>PMD scans Java source code</h2>
<ol>
<li>  Possible bugs - empty try/catch/finally/switch statements
<li>  Dead code - unused local variables, parameters and privat
e methods
<li>  Suboptimal code - wasteful String/StringBuffer usage
<li>  Overcomplicated expressions - unnecessary if statements,
for loops that could be while loops
<li>  Duplicate code - copied/pasted code means copied/paste
d bugs
</ol>
</section>


<section><h2>PMD RuleSets</h2>
<ol>
<li> 

Android Rules: These rules deal with the Android SDK.

<li> 

Basic Rules: The Basic Ruleset contains a collection of good practices which everyone should follow.

<li> 

Braces Rules: The Braces Ruleset contains a collection of braces rules.

<li> 

Clone Implementation Rules: The Clone Implementation ruleset contains a collection of rules that find questionable usages of the
clone() method.

<li> 

Code Size Rules: The Code Size Ruleset contains a collection of rules that find code size related problems.

<li> 

Controversial Rules: The Controversial Ruleset contains rules that, for whatever reason, are considered controversial.

<li> 

Coupling Rules: These are rules which find instances of high or inappropriate coupling between objects and packages.
</ol>
</section>

<section><h2>PMD RuleSets</h2>
<ol>

<li> 

Design Rules: The Design Ruleset contains a collection of rules that find questionable designs.

<li> 

Import Statement Rules: These rules deal with different problems that can occur with a class' import statements.

<li> 

JavaBean Rules: The JavaBeans Ruleset catches instances of bean rules not being followed.

<li> 

JUnit Rules: These rules deal with different problems that can occur with JUnit tests.

<li> 

Java Logging Rules: The Java Logging ruleset contains a collection of rules that find questionable usages of the logger.

<li> 

Migration Rules: Contains rules about migrating from one JDK version to another.

<li> 

Migration15: Contains rules for migrating to JDK 1.5

</section>

<section><h2>PMD RuleSets</h2>
<ol>
<li> 

Naming Rules: The Naming Ruleset contains a collection of rules about names - too long, too short, and so forth.

<li> 

Optimization Rules: These rules deal with different optimizations that generally apply to performance best practices.

<li> 

Strict Exception Rules: These rules provide some strict guidelines about throwing and catching exceptions.

<li> 

String and StringBuffer Rules: Problems that can occur with manipulation of the class String or StringBuffer.

<li> 

Security Code Guidelines: These rules check the security guidelines from Sun.

<li> 

Unused Code Rules: The Unused Code Ruleset contains a collection of rules that find unused code.

</section>

<section><h2>PMD Rule Examples</h2>
<ol>
<li> EmptyCatchBlock: finds instances where an exception is caught,
but nothing is done.  Should either be acted on or reported.
<li> EmptyIfStmt: finds instances where a condition
is checked but nothing is done about it.
<li> EmptyWhileStmt: finds instances where a while statement does
  nothing. If it is a timing loop, then you should use Thread.sleep()
  for it; if it's a while loop that does a lot in the exit expression,
  rewrite it to make it clearer.
<li>  EmptyTryBlock: Avoid empty try blocks - what's the point?
<li>  EmptyFinallyBlock: Empty finally blocks can be deleted.
<li>  EmptySwitchStatements: Avoid empty switch statements.
<li> JumbledIncrementer: Avoid jumbled loop incrementers
<li> ForLoopShouldBeWhileLoop: Some for loops can be more concisely written
as while loops.
</section>

<section><h2>CheckStyle</h2>
<ol>
<li>  Development tool to help programmers write Java c
ode that adheres to a coding standard.

<li> Highly configurable and can be made to support almost any coding
standard. An example configuration file is supplied supporting the
Sun/Oracle Code Conventions. Other sample configuration files are supplied
for other well known conventions.
